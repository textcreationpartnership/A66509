            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E have obſerved that it hath been of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great Benefit to many other Arts and Sciences, that Experiments and Obſervations either by chance or on ſet purpoſe being found out, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the Aetiology or the reaſons thereof, as much as may be, ſhould be ſet down, which thing we have much deſired in Phyſick, which may be juſtly placed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the nobleſt of the Sciences. In Mathematicks and Mechanicks experience and practice did firſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the Theory, then this ſhewing the cauſes of things and the means of their effecting, hath not only ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but very much increaſed and illuſtrated the practice. But the Medicinal Art, although at firſt known to Empiricks, and taken up by quacking Jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and old women, as if it were a Myſtery into whoſe Reaſons it were not lawful to ſearch, has remained hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto unexplicated: Wherefore the unlearned, and
<pb facs="tcp:40331:3"/> indeed ſometimes the learned at this time give Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines (like People ſhooting at random) raſhly and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt fortuitouſly; being uncertain whither they will tend, or what end or effects they ſhall have. From hence it is, that not only ſome learned Cynicks, but the vileſt of the ſcum of the people bark againſt and fling dirt upon Phyſick. And truly I know not how ſhe will be wholly excuſed from being called a Lyar, Vain and Jugler, ſo long as yet the reaſons of curing by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, on which the life and health of Man much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends, and oftentimes by which 'tis no leſs indanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, lye hid. But this Doctrine of Medicinal Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons either neglected or ignored, ſhewing like a great Chaſm, hath been the only, or at leaſt the greateſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment that Phyſick is not come to its perfection, and its whole Syſtem rightly framed: For though the matter of Medicine gotten from each family of the Vegetables, Minerals, and Animals, ſeems ſufficiently digeſted and compleated, and that the Types and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of all Diſeaſes being collected by moſt accurate Obſervations, are explicated by innumerable Authors, and beſides that the humane Body as it were a martial Field, where thoſe Champions try their Skill, be exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſcribed as to all its parts by Anatomiſts, yet what is of greateſt moment, and without which the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid things ſignifie little, is not yet ſufficiently and clearly detected, to wit, what the weapons of thoſe Champions are, what Furniture, what Force and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance they have, alſo what Action, Paſſion, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action may be between the Particles of the Medicine and the Spirits, Humors, and ſolid parts. But ſince al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the whole buſineſs of this Pharmaceutick Drame is acted behind the Curtain, therefore the various con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions of Particles, Fermentations, Impulſes, and
<pb facs="tcp:40331:3"/> other diverſities of motions, which performed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ly hid from the Senſes, are to be ſearched out by a more deep Scrutiny of the Intellect, which if it may be at laſt performed, there is nothing more will be deſired, whereby Phyſick being perfected in all its parts, may grow to a true Science and be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with greater certainty not inferior to the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks. For ſo the Empirical remedies left us by the Antients would not be adminiſtred promiſcuouſly and amiſs (as is wont now by medicaſters) in every ſtate of the Diſeaſe or caſe of the Sick, but oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely and always according to the moſt apt intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of healing. Beſides, new and more efficacious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines (as often as ſome great and unuſual Diſeaſes require them,) may be eaſily and ſafely found out, without any error of the Phyſician or danger of the Patient. For whilſt it clearly appears what kind of Particles in the Patient are either to be altered or ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up into motion, and what are required in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent for that work, it will be no difficult thing apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to deſign this, and rightly to accommodate one to the other. But the buſineſs is far otherwiſe perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by thoſe Pſeudochymiſts with notable danger and abuſe of the humane Body, who not contented with the uſe of received and approved remedies, bragg that they have framed in their Furnaces no leſs than a great Elixir, a certain Panacea, or an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Medicine, whilſt in the mean time they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfully meddle with Minerals, expecting a certain uncertain event rather than deſigning any thing ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly; If perchance there ſhould appear an unuſual product with this new Medicine (the virtues of which are alltogether unknown, or are none, or poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous) they promiſe themſelves preſently to cure all
<pb facs="tcp:40331:4"/> Diſeaſes, and give it boldly in every caſe to the great hurt, and not ſeldom to the Diſtruction of the Sick; ſo ſecurely and raſhly are theſe Executioners wont to ſport with mans Life, whilſt they are led to the preparing or adminiſtring theſe Medicines (in which always lurks ſome venemous Sting) without any coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel or direction of Method, but by mere chance and with a certain blind undertaking.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it is highly to be wiſhed, both for the Dignity and Augmentation of Medicine, and for the Cure and ſafety of mans Health, that the Ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies and manner, as to the nature of each, and as it were the mechanical means of the working of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines in our Bodies might be laid open. For if it ſhall be plainly known by what means Medicines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken do preſently exerciſe their powers in the firſt Paſſages, and from thence by and by diffuſe them thorow the whole Body, and what alteration they receive in each Region, and what they do or perform upon the Spirits or Blood, and Humors or ſolid Parts, then indeed Evacuation may be much more ſafely and certainly uſed, and with greater Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to the Sick.</p>
                  <p>But if having boldly aſſaulted this Province, to wit, the ſhewing a reaſon of the pharmaceutical O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration before untouched, I ſhall not ſufficiently perform my work, I do however deſerve Pardon becauſe I am forced to travel thorow not only an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Cuntry, but alſo one that is uneven and as it were a Labyrinth; and if perhaps going thorow this tract I have not yet ſufficiently found out all the more ſecret Receſſes, and every more intimate Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and what is acted in them; yet I ſuppoſe that I have made way for others, who may have a mind
<pb facs="tcp:40331:4"/> more accuratly to find them out.</p>
                  <p>For truly if theſe two things which I have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in the whole Diſquiſition ſhould be exactly known, <hi>viz.</hi> By what means Medicines or their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles affect the Animal Spirits in every place, alſo by what and how many ways they Ferment the Blood and Humours, from thence a Path would lead to the unfolding the Reaſons of every Evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. For the better laying open of the ways of the whole curing by Medicines, we have taken care to have accurately diſcribed the Ventricle and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines, even to all the Membranes and Fibres of them, in which the Animal Spirits dwell, and where they are firſt of all affected by the Particles of the Medicine. For although the Subſtances, Figures, Cavities, Sites and Connexions of theſe are long ſince ſufficiently enough delineated, yet we have manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed moſt clearly without any example or following of any other Authors, the Nervous and Muſculary and Glandulous Membranes of each of them, and ſome Fibres meerly ſenſible, and others motional, as alſo the thick ſet enfoldings of the ſanguiferous Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and innumerable Glandulas incruſting the Back of the interior Coat from the Mouth even to the Anum, this making very much for the illuſtrateing the pharmaceutical Doctrin: concerning which Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomical Inventions I muſt acknowledg my ſelf to be beholden (as formerly to ſome others ſo now again) to the Induſtry and ſedulous Pains of the Learned Doctor <hi>King;</hi> and alſo my Friend Doctor <hi>Masters</hi> hath ſet to his helping Hand, in the finiſhing of this Task.</p>
                  <p>At the begining of this Work I did deſign to handle the whole Pharmacie and to weigh the reaſons
<pb facs="tcp:40331:5"/> of all or at leaſt its chief Operations: But whilſt this work was under my Hands it grew into ſo great a Bulk through the Fertility of the ſubject, that I was forc'd to break off long before the end, and to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh it before I had half done. For beſides the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Medicines whoſe Energies and manner of working we have already deſcribed, there are other remedies (commonly called Specifick and Appropi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate) which belong to this Speculation; to wit, which are given to cure either ſome peculiar Diſeaſes, or which are ſaid to reſpect ſome Region or part of the Body. Of ſome of theſe and eſpecially of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines proper for the Breaſt I had begun ſome Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. But when I conſider that I muſt Sail in a dangerous Sea, every where full of Rocks of Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and Contumelies. I think it no Wiſdom to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture my whole Cargo at once in this weak Bottom, but firſt of all with theſe few to try my Fortune, which if it be proſperous, I may perhaps be leſs affraid to expoſe the reſt of this Nature hereafter.</p>

For that as ſeveral men made tryal of ſeveral remedies, if they found any by Experience to be helpful in any Diſeaſe, the ſame was made uſe of to others alſo in the like Caſe. Wherefore, as <hi>Herodotus</hi> tells us, the antient Egyptians did not carry their ſick to the Phyſitian, but ſet them in the ſtreets and high-ways that they might conſult the Paſſengers for Cure of their Diſeaſes. And ſo,<note place="margin">Its increaſe and progreſs.</note> both the Prieſts of theſe and of the Greeks; taking notice by what remedy every one was healed, committing it to writing, they laid up careful in their Temples their obſervations, that they might on occaſion be communicated to other ſick people. After this, the Heap of obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations dayly increaſing, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> Phyſick began to be reduced into precepts and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40331:12"/> method, and upon this double hinge, almoſt all the whole buſineſs turn'd, to wit that the matter of Medicine with all its furniture, might be aptly diſpenſed, and in ſeveral forms of preſcriptions, and alſo that the <hi>Indicationes Therapeuticae,</hi> or the ſetting forth of the method of Curing, with the uſe of the medicinal Houſholdſtuff, might be rightly made known. If any one were very skilful in theſe two parts, he was thought to bear away the Bell in the Medicinal part of Phyſick. But truly in this matter,<note place="margin">The ſhewing the reaſons of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal Operations deſired.</note> and in the practice of Phyſick we may deſervedly place among the things that are to be deſired, what hath as yet been unfolded by no body, by what order, and by what affection of the parts of the humane Body, Medicines being taken inwardly, or outwardly applyed, do perform their operations, to wit, how and why this vomits that purges, others ſweat, or move to ſome alteration, or operation of ſome other kind; what affinity there is of the parts and particulars in the agent, and patient, or diſſimilitude, pulſion, impulſion, and reaction: and then with what ſtrugling and fermentation they are agitated, when mix'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and by what Workmanſhip or Energie they produce their effects. The vulgar Solution of theſe was wont to be, that Medicines did work by certain ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick Virtues, and did exerciſe their peculiar Powers, which thing truly is no more than to explicate the ſame thing by the ſame thing, as if they ſhould ſay that ſome things are Vomits, becauſe they are indued with the faculty of provoking us to vomit. Therefore for as much as this Therapeutic ſpeculation has been almoſt left hitherto untouch'd by Phyſitians,<note place="margin">The Reaſon of theſe things en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanically.</note> it will ſeem worth the while to enquire into the reaſon as it were mechanically, which way Medicaments of every kind do exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe their force in our Bodies, to wit, that at our pleaſures theſe do ſtir up the motion of avoyding the excrements in the Bowels or ſtop it, theſe excite the effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſcencie of the Blood and Humours, or reſtrain them, and moreover by what peculiar reſpect they are able to yield comfort, as it were Tribute, to the wants of every part or member, or to irregular parts. Here, although it is not much to the purpoſe in what order the <hi>Species</hi> of Medicines are recited, yet for methods ſake it ſeems good to me firſt of all to ſhew ſome general reaſons of them, and in the next place to reduce them into <hi>Claſſes.</hi> Therefore as to the operations of medicines we ought chiefly to diſtinguiſh the places in which the virtues or their Energies do firſt and chiefly ſhew themſelves,<note place="margin">The Places of the operations of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines in the firſt place noted.</note> which commonly are wont to be divided into three Regions: <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, into the firſt paſſages, in which chiefly are comprehended the Ventricle, Inteſtines, the Pipe of the Gall, and Pancreas, and alſo the Mouths of the Meſeraick Veſſels.

When the Virtue of the Medicines touch them, whether theſe parts or thoſe, they ſtir them up either by irrirating them into an extruding motion, or by comforting them make them expand themſelves more largely,<note place="margin">The <hi>Spices</hi> of the Humours reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> and as it were rejoyce, or by aſſwaging qualifie their Diſorders, and take away their Pains, or laſtly by ſcattering them, they lull their Furie aſleep. The Humours in which Medicines inwardly taken do impreſs their force, are both the Ferments, and Obliniments of the Ventricle and Inteſtines, The Blood with the nouriſhing <hi>Succus,</hi> and droſs, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Serum</hi> or Whey, either <hi>Bilis,</hi> the Pancreatick Juice the wateriſh Humour; and alſo the nervous Liquor: upon which ſometimes ſingly,<note place="margin">After what manner Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines act upon them.</note> and ſometimes together, Medicines do diverſely operate, in as much as they fling them down and deſtroy them, or reduce them from that ſtate: Sometimes they ſtir them up when ſloathful, or if too much boyling, they allay and gently aſſwage them, or laſtly they alter them being enormant in Quality, Conſiſtencie, Temperament and other Accidents, and ſenſibly reſtore them to their genuine
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40331:12"/> Conſtitution. When therefore there are ſo many and ſo various Conſiderations about the Operations of Medicines, the thread of our method leads to the places in which their forces do firſt and moſt chiefly appear; and in that reſpect we will begin with Catharticks, both Vomitory and Purging:<note place="margin">The deſigned me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of this Tract.</note> Then we will handle next Diuretick Medicaments, Diaphoretick, and Cordials: and laſtly we will ſpeak of Opiats and Specificks, as they are vulgarly called, that is, of Medicines reſpecting, either the defects, or inequalities of the inward parts of each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Member. In the handling of each of theſe,<note place="margin">Three things to be conſidered in every Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> we ſhall obſerve theſe three things <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, We will ſhew in every kind of Evacuation the means whereby Medicines do operate and affect, either the Spirits, or the Humours of humane Bodies, or both of them, and with them alſo the ſolid parts. Secondly, We will take notice of all the Kinds of every Claſs of Medicines, or at leaſt the chief of them, together with the more ſelect forms of Preſcriptions. Thirdly we will deſcribe the Chymical Remedies of the firſt rank which belong to each, and the Reaſons of them, that is, the Variations of Changes and Accidents which happen in their preparations, as alſo we will add the reaſons of their Virtues and Effects, which appear in them when they are prepared. In the fourth place there may be ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added to theſe another Exercitation in the medicinal part of Phyſick, to wit, that other more elegant, and more profitable proviſions of theſe kind of Medicines, the reaſons of Chymical preparations being rightly weighed, may be found out. But we will reſerve this Inſtitution for ſome other time becauſe it contains Secrets eaſily violated by thoſe raſh Quack-ſalvers, who not without danger to the ſick make experiments dayly of every medicinal Precept they find written, without any Controul. But that which is next to be done is that we deſcribe, briefly and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately the firſt Paſſages, vulgarly ſo called, in humane Bodies: <hi>viz.</hi> In which Medicines do firſt of all begin to operate, and are as it were the ſtage of every medicinal Action.</p>

                        <p>SInce that Medicines are carried by the ſame ways into the humane Body as Food, and are born every where throw the ſame Pipes, it will be therefore of uſe,<note place="margin">The firſt paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. <hi>viz.</hi> The Mouth of the Stomach, Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines, are the Stage of every medicinal ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</note> for the right underſtanding the means how it is done, as well for the reaſons of the Chyle as of the Evacuation, that we deliniate a certain Scene of the Parts and Inwards, in which either of theſe do act their Comedie. But to do this fully and amply in all its proportions, were to exhibite the Anatomie of the whole humane Body. Wherefore we will only deliniate briefly thoſe parts, into which Medicines are received, and where they begin to operate. Theſe are then the <hi>Oeſophagus</hi> or mouth of the Stomach, the Ventricle, and the Inteſtines with their appendices, in which not only Vomits and Purges, but alſo Cordials, Opiates,<note place="margin">The Spirits, and the Humours, the immediat ſubjects of Medicines.</note> Diapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, yea and all other kind of Medicines, do firſt of all manifeſt their Virtues, and are determined to ſhew their Energies. We will not therefore give you a perfect deſcription of theſe (which hath already been done accurately by other Anatomiſts,) but only brief Commentaries,<note place="margin">The mediat are the Fibres, mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, veſſels and leading Pipes.</note> which may ſerve to illuſtrate the buſineſs of Evacuation. Since then all Medicines more immediatly act upon the Spirits, or the humours, or on both together, and that the Subjects of them are the Fibres, Membranes, Veſſells, and leading Pipes, we will particularly declare how theſe abide in the aforeſaid Inwards, and how they are wont to affect.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Oeſophagus,</hi> according to the opinion of all Men, and common Obſervation,<note place="margin">The <hi>Oeſophgus</hi> conſiſts of three Coats.</note> conſiſts of three Coats. The interior of theſe hath as it were a certain Covering on its innermoſt Superficies, conſiſting in Fibres, as it were very ſmall Hairs which covers its hollowneſs all over as it were with a certain Down;<note place="margin">The more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Coat full of Nerves, and covered with a hairy Cruſt.</note> the reſt of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this Coat, is altogether nervous, endued with Fibres of various kinds, and diverſely interwoven, like to the interior Coat of the Ventricle and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40331:13"/> Moreover this Membrane is continued to that which covers the Palate, Mouth, Jawes, and Lips: and alſo deſcending down even to the Ventricle, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſeth about its Mouth, and covers it round below on the inſide of the Mouth, for the ſpace of three Fingers breadth. This extreme part, within the Orifice of the Stomach, of this Nervous Coat, which is ſomewhat thick, and hairy, appears very diſtinctly from the more inward Coat of the Ventricle which it covers;<note place="margin">Covers for ſome ſpace and enters into the Mouth of the Ventricle.</note> which by a ſmall Elixation may be more fully diſcerned; for then that Coat coming down from the Throat, appears wonderfully white, and otherwiſe, and more inward than that of the Stomach. This part without doubt ſerves chiefly to make the ſenſe exquiſite. Hence therefore grateful things being eaten, and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed down, a grateful affection of pleaſure accompanies them even to the entrance of the Ventricle: ſo alſo from ingrateful things eaten, or thought upon by an irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation here made,<note place="margin">And makes the ſenſe of the lust in the whole throat and Mouth of the Ventricle.</note> there oftentimes follows Nauſeouſneſs and Vomitings. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the deep letting in of this Coat into the Ventricle makes that intimate and quick intercourſe between the Stomach and the Throat; ſo that if either part be provoked to Vomiting, preſently the other is led by conſent: and ſince the ſame Coat cloaths alſo other parts of the Mouth and Palate, theſe in like manner by a natural conſent are affected in Vomiting.</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <note place="margin">The ſecond Coat of the <hi>Oeſopha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> or middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt being fleſhy ſerves for moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>2. The next Coat of the Throat is ſomewhat fleſhy and thick, as if it were a pierced Muſcle. <hi>Hofmannus</hi> indeed aſſerts it to be a Muſcle and to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the Palſie and to Convulſions. The fleſhie Fibres of this Coat were commonly thought round and tranſverſe: but <hi>Clar. Stenon</hi> hath obſerved them to be ſpiral and of a double order, which mutually ſtrike between one another, and are formed like two Cockles put oppoſite one to another. Upon theſe, as much as I have been able to collect by my own obſervation, the whole <hi>Oeſopha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> ſeems to be compoſed of two Muſcles knit together, which make four parallel Lines with the Oppoſite Fibres,<note place="margin">Two oppoſite orders of the moving Fibres.</note> and cutting one another acroſs. This plainly may be perceived, if this middle Coat of the Throat be taken off from the reſt, and the extreme parts being tyed, it be diſtended by inflation, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times immerg'd in ſeething Water, that the Fibres may be contracted and ſwell, for ſo there will be diſcerned two ſeries of deſcending Fibres with their Tendons. Then if this Coat be turnd on the other ſide, and be likewiſe blown up, the oppoſite orders of the aſcending Fibres will appear to your ſight. Laſtly, if the Coat be cut in two in the middle by the long Tendon, and folded out plain, there will appear two parallel Lines on one ſuperficies, and as many oppoſite upon the other.</p>

But the chief Office of them is to receive the approach of ſenſible things, and preſently do deliver them to the common ſenſe, ſo that according to the affections either to things pleaſing or diſpleaſing there ſtirred up, the motions of ſwallowing or rejecting might be continued, or excited a new.</p>

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40331:13"/> moved in Swallowing, Spitting, Vomiting, Yauning, and other affections, and when the other inward membranous parts, and chiefly the Ventricle and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines, are on every ſide moved: It ought to be unfolded how theſe various Actions, or paſſions are executed, and by what Fibres, and after what manner they are affected.</p>

                        <p>Agreeable to this we have ſhown lately in a peculiar Tract, that, and how,<note place="margin">Contraction on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly performed by fleſhy Fibres.</note> every motion of Contraction is performed only by fleſhy Fibres, <hi>viz.</hi> Theſe by the ſudden ruſhing in of the Spirits (which leap from the tendinous Fibres) being inflated and blown up, are preſently made ſhorter, ſo that they thereby ſnatch up the parts hanging next them. But truly ſince it very plainly appears, ſome nervous parts, and eſpecially the hollow <hi>Viſcera</hi> or inward parts, not only to be contracted, but expanded, much blown upon, and inlarged into a greater capacity, which cannot certainly be made by the motion of Contraction; and ſince further it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appears that the animal Spirits move no leſs among the nervous Fibres, than in the fleſhie, and not only to fill them gently, but ſometimes to leap forth, very much irritated, or thruſt forth more impetuouſly. Theſe I ſay being premiſed, we will not doubt to conclude that the animal Spirits filling the nervous, or membranous Fibres, do not only effect ſenſation, which is their proper function,<note place="margin">Expanſion cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Fibres.</note> but alſo certain local motions, to wit, expanſion, or inflation. For whilſt the animal Spirits in their extruſion being agitated, and notably rarified, do more impetuouſly enter into theſe Fibres (which as well as the fleſhie, being diſpoſed not in certain orders but every where about, may be very much attenuated, and in the greater expanſions diſtended, and dilated) there is a neceſſity that the inward parts framed of theſe ſhould be every where blown up, and their ſides on all parts unfolded, and being to the utmoſt attenuated, ſhould be enlarged into a greater Capacity. Truly by the inſtitution of Nature, as often as it happens to come to paſs after this manner, it is certainly, that whilſt the parts which the membranes do order, ſtretch under or cover, by this means are expanded, the ſuperfluous Humours, or thoſe that being infixed moleſt them, or ſuch as ſtick to them, might be ſhook off and removed. For this end, and by this means, we think Stretchings,<note place="margin">At in Stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Yauning, and Inflations of the inward parts.</note> Yaunings and other certain motions of inflation and diſtention to be excited. Wherefore as in Yauning, we find the Pipe of the <hi>Oeſophagus</hi> whether we will or no to be inlarged, and as it were blown up, and ſtretch'd out by a certain wind, we may conclude this affection to ariſe from thence, for as much as the inward Coat of the Throat, that it might ſhake off it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Moreover whilſt we ſtrive to hinder this motion of Yauning (becauſe it ſeems always troubleſome, and unhandſom) preſently the fleſhy Fibres of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Coat, are moved to contraction: whereby there ariſes a certain ſtrugling in the Coats of the <hi>Oeſophagus</hi> (which we may eaſily perceive) made by theſe oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite endeavours of expanſion and contraction. By what means the animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits do blow upon the membranous <hi>Viſcera</hi> in convulſive Affections, and lift them up, and intumefie, counterfieting the ſpringing up of live Animals, is ſhown by us in ſome other place. Further, when by ſome incongruous Medicine, or Poyſon, Diſtentions and horrid inflations of the Ventricle or Inteſtines, and that not ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſudden and exceſſive riſing up of the whole <hi>Abdomen</hi> happen;<note place="margin">The Extenſion of the membranes cauſed by the thruſting forth of the Spirits.</note> they are thus made, in as much as the animal Spirits being highly irritated, and brought to uſe their exploſive force, they run altogether into the membranous Fibres, and extend them to their utmoſt,; that the inward or <hi>Viſcus</hi> which is knit to them is preſently wholly blown up, and as much as it poſſibly may be is enlarged.

For if theſe nervous Fibres are made hollow and like a Pipe, and that the Wind on a ſudden is blown into them, there is a neceſſity that that Veſſel about which they are woven, ſhould be thereby diſtended and dilated. In like manner alſo it is when the Spirits, as it were ſtruck with a Fury, do ruſh more impetuouſly into them. For this conjunct Cauſe, the Ventricle, being ſo affected, is wont to be blown up in Hyſterical Paroxyſms, and Colicks, and very often in the Hypochondriack paſſion. From hence alſo ſighs ariſe, and their reciprocations, which happen, becauſe that the Ventricle, by theſe Fibres, is ſometimes inflated, and ſometims thruſt back by the <hi>Syſtole</hi> of the <hi>Diaphragma.</hi> Laſtly, deadly and venemous Medicines, in as much as they ſtimulate the Spirits, and furiouſly ſtir them up into theſe Fibres, they often induce horrid Inflations and Diſtenſions of the other Inwards of the Ventricle,<note place="margin">The reaſon of the Tympany hinted.</note> and almoſt from the like Reaſon we affirm the Tympanie to ariſe.</p>
                        <p>This Interior Coat in healthful Bodies has many wrinkles, or folds, ſhewing themſelves in the hollow Superficies of the Ventricle, which ſeem to be as it were ſo many Furrows or Incloſures, into which the ſmall portions of the Chyle are ſcattered here and there, and detained by degrees for the ſake of the better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, and that they might not flow together into a thick Maſs.<note place="margin">How the folds and wrinkles of the Ventricle are made, and for what uſe.</note> Theſe Folds are made, for that this Coat is much larger then the exterior fleſhy Coat, it is therefore neceſſary that it ſhould have folds, or wrinkles, that it may be contained by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

Without doubt the Office of theſe is, while they are contracted, to draw upwards the bottom and ſides of the Ventricle, and thereby to ſtraiten its cavity, ſo that what is contained therein, being ſpread abroad either towards this or that Orifice, might be evacuated. The exterior or convex Superficies of this fleſhy Coat with the order of motricious Fibres, is exactly delineated in the third Table.</p>
                        <p>But that its extruding motion might be determinately made, either towards this or that Orifice, and the matter included in the Stomach might be conveyed forth either by Vomit, or by Seige, is the work of the other Series of Fibres, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tranſverſe in reſpect of the other, bring together one Extremity of the Stomach, ſc. the left or right, againſt the other; So that whilſt the Fibres of both kinds do coact, the Stomach being contracted in all its dimenſions, and broad upwards, doth caſt out what is contained therein by that Orifice to which on occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion it is inclined.

Then after a light immerſion in warm Water, the hairy Cruſt being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, and taken away, we may ſee the nervous Coat it ſelf, covered over with a moſt thick Ramification of Veſſels: we have taken care that the portions of either of theſe and the ſuperficies of them, with the Glandula's, and to which of the Veſſels they ſtick, may be diſcerned in deſcribing exactly the ſecond and third Figure of the ſame Table.<note place="margin">Their deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> Then laſtly the nervous Coat being wholly taken away, the interior fibrous Superficies of the fleſhy or middle Coat, as it is delineated to the Life in the fifth Table, appears in view. So that in this Ramification of fleſhy Fibres there is a notable order, which are ſeen to ariſe behind the Mouth of the Ventricle, and to compaſs about its left extremity, and then they are carried forward towards the right region of the Stomach. A notable company of theſe running along on either ſide in ſtreight Lines to the top or ſummit of the Ventricle, enter into the hole of the <hi>Pylorus,</hi> hiding here and there the length of its Cavitie, terminates in the Orifice it ſelf, as it is repreſented in the fifth Figure. But the other Fibres of this Order range on both ſides of the Stomach obliquely,<note place="margin">The uſe of its Fibres.</note> and ſo likewiſe towards its bottom, where they meet. The Office of the former ſeems to be applied to what is to be done by either of the Orifices, by one for the avoyding the excrements, which is done by the lower, and alſo reſpectively by the upper; for the ſame Fibres draw to the right or left, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the convulſion beginning at this or that end of them; as we have ſhown in our Tract of the motion of the Muſcles, lately publiſhed. If at any time a contraction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins towards the <hi>Pylorus,</hi> whilſt there the bottom of the Ventricle and the ſides are drawn together by other Fibres, both interior, and exterior, its mouth alſo is by thoſe right ones inclined towards the <hi>Pylorus,</hi> therefore what ever is contained in the Stomach is tranſmitted to the Inteſtines. But if the contraction be begun by other Fibres at the end of theſe, towards the mouth of the Ventricle, whilſt there, its
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40331:16"/> bottom and ſides are drawn together by other Fibres, the <hi>Pylorus</hi> alſo is drawn together towards it, for the action of Vomiting. As to what reſpects the other oblique Fibres of this order, whilſt by a Convulſion beginning from the right end of them, they are drawn downward and obliquely,<note place="margin">The ſame fleſhy Fibres effect op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite contracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> by their motion they incline the left chamber of the Ventricle towards the bottom and <hi>Pylorus,</hi> cooking for nouriſhment, what is there more ſtrictly compreſſed and rolled together: On the other ſide alſo, by the Convulſion begun from the left, they being contracted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and obliquely, cauſe the bottom and right chamber of the Ventricle to be ſnatch'd up towards its mouth, to excite Vomiting. According to either of theſe contractions, the exterior fleſhie Fibres, conſtituting the convex ſuperficies of the middle Coat conſpire in the action, ſo that they ſtrain more the cavity of the Ventricle, and more aptly compoſe the endeavours for evacuation upward or downward. Wherefore according to which, an irritation being here or there made, a contraction begins either towards the <hi>Pylorus</hi> or the mouth of the Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and the whole capacity of the Ventricle being collected, and brought upwards, it is inclined hither or thither, and endeavours to caſt forth either above or below. We have taken care that either ſuperficies of this Coat, and the diſtinct ſeries of the motricious Fibres therein, be exactly deſcribed in the Figures of the third and fifth Table. I ſhall not in this place reherſe and explicate every ſpecies of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive motions, which this fleſhy Tunicle of the Ventricle hath; of which ſort are ſuch as are wont to be ſtirr'd up in thoſe that are affected with the Cramp, we ſhall ſhew them in another place, and we will declare how they are moved by the operations of Medicines, when we ſhall treat of each in their kind. In the mean time we will take notice of thoſe motions to which this fleſhy Coat is wont to obey, the Inſtinct or Impulſe diverſly to be communicated, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt of all, and chiefly from the nervous Coat lying under, which,<note place="margin">What contracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the fleſhy Tunicle follows: The inſtinct from whence.</note> as from the contents of the Ventricle it is variouſly affected, by and by, for retention or expulſion ſake provokes into contractions of this or that ſort.

The Fibres of this membrane (as we have already obſerv'd) are in certain places more thick, that when the Ventricle is fill'd beyond its meaſure it might be very much diſtended. Theſe ſeem to ſerve but little for motion, but yet ſomewhat to ſenſe; although there ſhould be but a very ſmall uſe of it, for that nothing from without can fall upon it, nor any thing taken in at the Mouth can touch it. But if that ſome ſerous Humour or impoſtume, or conſtant bilious Suffuſion happen on the neighbouring or contiguous parts, for as much as this Coat is much, and often irritated, there is excited in the Stomach almoſt a continual nauſeouſneſs, want of Appetite, and frequent Vomiting, as I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in very many that have been diſſected after they have been dead. The chief uſe of this Tunicle is, that being the whole covering of the Ventricle,<note place="margin">And perhaps tendinous.</note> it cloaths the fleſhy Fibres of the underlying Membrane, ſuſtains the Ramifications of the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells, and ſerves as well for the ſtrengthning the Ventricle, as for to conſerve its heat. Moreover it is not improbable, that there are in certain places of this Coat ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Fibres, in the place of Tendons, reſpecting the fleſhy Fibres lying under them.</p>

                           </note>The other Orifice commonly called the <hi>Pylorus</hi> on the right ſide of the Stomach having a capacious hole, by degrees grows long and narrow, and ends in a ſmall hole, and from thence being retorted it is continued into the <hi>Duodenum.</hi> Here the Tunicles are much more thick than in any other place of the Ventricle. The ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous innermoſt is very rough with wrinkles and furrows, and is lifted up into the very hole it ſelf, in a longiſh lump like to the Pipe of a Gutter, for the end certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the Chyle going forth by degrees may not be ſuck'd back again into the Stomach. The fleſhy Tunicle, as every where beſides, hath two ſeries of Fibres; for ſome compaſſing about the Hole they bind it, and as occaſion ſerves, ſhut it faſt; and others being carried by its ſides the whole length of them, gathering to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the other parts of the Stomach upward, do lead towards this door.

                           </note>The Office of the Pylorus is, not only largely to tranſmit what is contained in the Ventricle, and together in great heaps, to the Inteſtines (which indeed it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently doth in purges and <hi>Diarrhaeas</hi>) but rather the Chyle being well digeſted, to receive it into its boſom, and to keep it there for ſome time, and then by little and little and by very ſmall portions thruſt it forth. For truly its den being long, and capacious, it ſeems to be a certain reſting or baiting place in the Ventricle into which a portion of the Chylous Maſs, being more thorowly digeſted and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, may retire, and abide in quiet, until another part more crude, and latelier put in, may be more concocted in the bottom of the Ventricle. Hence it is, that when things have been eaten, oftentimes that which is ingrateful is vomited up, the other more grateful meats in the mean time remaining in the Stomach; <hi>viz.</hi> for that there are very many as it were diſtinct Cells in the Ventricle, in which thoſe things put in are divided one from another, and may ſo remain. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over it is to be obſerved that vomiting Medicines when they work gently, do only ſtir the parts next the left Orifice of the Ventricle, but if they do more ſtrongly irritate them, they draw from within, and upwards the <hi>Pylorus</hi> it ſelf with the <hi>Duodenum</hi> hanging to it, ſo as to make an Evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the forc'd <hi>Bilis</hi> into the Ventricle.</p>

After what manner the Sanguiferous Veſſels inſerted into the bottom and top of the Stomach do hide all its ſuperficies with a thick and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Ramification, is to the life expreſſed in the firſt Figure.</p>
                        <p n="3">3.

In the former, as much as belongs to the medicinal part, there ought to be conſidered firſt their ſite and Fabrick, ſecondly their Tunicles, and thirdly their Veſſels and leading Pipe. The Office of theſe is, to receive the Chyle elaborated and dreſſed in the Ventricle, to ferment it more, and from it more elabourated and perfected to preſs forth the nutritious Juice into the Chyliferous Veſſels. Among theſe Inteſtines Cathartick Medicines do chiefly perform their ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
                        <p>Although there be but one continued Pipe of the ſmall Guts, yet for the diſtinct Offices that they have,<note place="margin">The ſite and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions of the ſmall Guts.</note> they are diſtinguiſhed as it were into three <hi>Stadia,</hi> and as if there were ſo many Guts, have ſo many diſtinct names impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on them. In the firſt of theſe the Chyle deſcending from the <hi>Pylorus,</hi> by and by is ſtained with new Ferments, <hi>viz.</hi> Choler and the Pancreatick juice, with which, ſince all its Maſſe by degrees, and all its parts ought to be imbued, therefore every portion paſſeth by a ſwift paſſage into this Region, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Duodenum.</hi> In the next Circuit, to wit, the Jejune or empty Gut, the Chyle fermenting is ſtrained more freed from ſourneſs, and acquires a greater vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latileneſs; and as here alſo it ought not to ſtay long, by and by being fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it is carried forward, and leaves for the moſt part the pipe empty. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the third Den, the Chyle being volatiliſed and perfected, is copiouſly hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped up, and ſtays there for ſome time, whilſt the Inteſtine <hi>Ileon</hi> being ſo full of Chyle, ſtrains it a little with is fleſhy Fibres, the more pure and ſubtiler part is preſſed forth to be tranſmitted to the blood, into the milkie Veſſels (and alſo according to our opinion into the Meſaraick Veins) and at length the reſt of the <hi>Faeces,</hi> and almoſt worn out are moved forward to the thick Inteſtines.</p>
                        <p>All theſe Inteſtines, or the whole Pipe of them,<note place="margin">There are three Coats of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines.</note> have their Coats formed after the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40331:18"/> ſame manner, which alſo do not much differ from the membranes of the Ventricle, unleſs that they are a little thinner. All the Inteſtines, both the ſmall and the thick (except in the beginning and end of them, and a certain part of the <hi>Colon</hi> which is joyned to the <hi>Omentum</hi>) are as it were plainly knit to the brim of the Circular Meſenterie: Concerning which in the mean time it is wonderful, how that theſe Inteſtines which are about ſix Ells long, may be comprehended in that compaſs, that they are not above a Span diſtant from the Centre. Alſo we may obſerve, that the Plane of the Meſenterie is collected into many and great folds,<note place="margin">How they are tyed to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenterie.</note> and hath in its Circumference the length of three Ells; moreover that the Circumference of the Meſenterie, that it might preſs together the length of the Inteſtines, doth enfold in every ſingle handful about twelve handfuls of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines. As for many reaſons it ought to be made after this manner, ſo chiefly, both that the Inteſtines might ſubſiſt in a little and narrow place diſtinctly, and without confuſion; and alſo that they might be moved, by a ſlow and ſucceſſive motion, and as it were creepingly, from one end to the other. For as much as the Tendons of the motricious Fibres, by which the Pipes or Cavities of the Inteſtines are drawn together, are placed on the Brim or Border of the Meſenterie, it is from this Inward, that the inſtinct of every Inteſtinal motion proceeds, as ſhall anon be more clearly ſhown: In the mean time, we will a little handle the Coats of the ſmall Guts.</p>

But this Coat conſiſting of every kind of Fibres, and conſtituting the inmoſt Chamber of the Inteſtinal Pipe, ſerves firſt of all for Senſation, and provokes according to the impreſſions made on it ſelf, the fleſhy Coat lying over it, to aſſiſt the excretorie motions more ſlow, or more ſwift upwards (but that rarely) or downwards. If at any time the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſuperficies of this be ſtimulated by ſharp things contained in it, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous Humours do ſtrike againſt its Fibres, preſently by reaſon of the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Senſe, troubleſome griefs and torments are ſtirred up.

                        <p>In the mean time it is not to be thought that the contractions of either kind of Fibres are ſo great and continual,<note place="margin">What kind of motion the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines have.</note> that all the contents of the Inteſtines are driven forward altogether from one part to another (although that this doth ſometimes happen in purges and looſeneſs as we think) but ordinarily thoſe lighter, and broken Convulſions, but yet made one ſeries after another, and often repeated, do as it were ſhake the Inteſtines, ſo that they make the Chyle and the <hi>faeces</hi> gently to move forward from place to place. But by reaſon of theſe ſhakings of the Inteſtines, and their often repeated contractions, the Chyle being perpetually agitated, is the more elaborated and eaſily preſſed forth into the Veſſells gaping for its reception.

As often as any thing that is diſagreeing, or incongruous, impreſſeth any troubleſome ſenſation upon the nervous Fibres, preſently to ſhake it off, the moving Fibres draw to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the affected part of the Inteſtine, that they might drive away whatever is troubleſom.</p>

Secondly the nervous Fibres are a little more ſharply agitated by Choler, and the pancreatick Juice from their Pipes, alſo by ſharp Humours, and hurtful Suffuſions from within the Arteries, whereby the ſame more often, and more ſtrong contractions ſucceed.

                        <p>HAving after this manner laid forth the Stage for medicinal Action, or at leaſt briefly ſhadowed forth its firſt Circle, it now is incumbent upon us to deſcribe the ſeveral kinds of medicinal Operations, the reaſons of them, and the ways of their Affecting. Therefore we will inquire from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning what is acted in the firſt <hi>Stadium,</hi> to wit, in the Ventricle, and how vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Medicines do work. Where in the firſt place it behoves us to explain, what kind of Affection Vomiting is, alſo for what cauſe, and upon what occaſions, either according or beſides Nature it is wont to be excited. Then in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place ſhall be ſhown upon what Parts, or Spirits inhabiting them, or the watry Humours, and after what manner Medicines, while they provoke to Vomit, do operate,</p>
                        <p>As to the firſt, when any one is affected with Vomiting,<note place="margin">How the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle and <hi>Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophagus</hi> are affected in Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting.</note> he may perceive in himſelf the Bottom of the Ventricle to be drawn upward, and the upper Orifice to be opened, and in the mean time (as it ſeems) the <hi>Pylorus</hi> being ſhut faſt, or drawn inward, by an inverſed motion at the ſame time the whole Pipe of the <hi>Oeſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phagus,</hi> to wit, from the Bottom to the Top, to endeavour as it were with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain kind of pumping, that what is therein contained may be thruſt up higher, and at laſt caſt forth at the Mouth. Theſe kinds of motions of theſe parts, are made without doubt by the fleſhy Fibres which compoſe the middle Coat of the Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. For we may perceive in this Coat, two diſtinct Orders of fleſhy or motional Fibres, which compaſs about the Stomach thorow its whole dimenſions, and being together contracted, they gather cloſe its Bottom and Sides, draw them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and incline them either towards this or that Orifice; for that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents may be caſt forth at the door, ſometimes at this, ſometimes at that. As to the interior Fibres, which determine the contractions of all the reſt either to this or to that Evacuation, if there be any where made about the Bottom or Sides of the Stomach, a gentle irritation, the Convulſion begins towards the <hi>Pylorus,</hi> and the internal moving Fibres are at their right Ends firſt and ſooneſt contracted, the whole joyning of the ventricle being there contracted, it pours forth its loding into the Inteſtines: but if the irritation be vehement, and very provoking in any part of the Stomach excited, it will not be eaſily reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or transferred towards the Inteſtines, the Convulſion beginning towards the left ends of the interior Fibres, and leading towards the Mouth of the Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, it makes there the whole Capacity of the Stomach being extremely ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and contracted, to be drawn up together; ſo that the <hi>Pylorus</hi> being drawn inwards and ſhut faſt, and the Mouth of the Ventricle open, what ever is therein contained, is caſt out upwards. The ſame fleſhy Fibres,<note place="margin">By what fleſhy Fibres the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is performed.</note> as the animal Spirits variouſly ſtirred up do leap forth out of theſe or thoſe Tendons firſt, in the right or left ends of them, there they begin their Convulſions, and are determined to provoke to Stool or to Vomit reſpectively. Moreover whilſt that the Ventricle is diſpoſed after the aforeſaid manner to the upper egeſtion, the <hi>Oeſophagus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires alſo in the action for the caſting forth its Contents upwards. And for as much as we have noted in the fleſhy Coat two double orders of moving Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres, of which one of them aſcending obliquely, the other deſcending, they all mutually do cut one another; the Office of the former ſeems to be, that they in ſtraining to Vomit being one ſeries after another contracted, may ſhut up the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40331:22"/> Throat behind for the caſting forth of its Balaſt, and ſo cauſe it to be forced to that gaping of the Mouth.</p>
                        <p>Vomiting therefore, for as much as it is a violent motion of the Stomach, and very often involuntary,<note place="margin">Vomiting or a Convulſive mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> it is not undeſervedly called Convulſive; which further we do affirm to proceed from the Exploſion, or a certain great Expanſion (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our Spaſmologie deliver'd in another place) of the animal Spirits, which poſſeſs theſe fleſhy Fibres. For truly theſe Spirits being highly irritated and then preſently burſting forth, they firſt of all ruſh impetuouſly from the Tendons plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted near the left Orifice, and then preſently out of others into the fleſhy Fibres, and highly inflate and abbreviate them, ſo that the whole parts of that Coat being brought nigh together one after another, the whole Cavitie of the Stomach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtraitned, and folded together, and ſo contracted upwards towards the left O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifice, it drives forward or more upward as it were with the ſtroke of a Bolt, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is therein contained, that it may be bolted forth by Vomiting.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">How Vomiting differs from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Convulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note>In moſt of the other kinds of Convulſions, the convulſive motion is wont to be made towards the ſame limit as the natural: but Vomiting ſeems to be an affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on contrary or at leaſt oppoſite to the ordinary and natural Action of the Stomach. For it is its ſolemn and almoſt conſtant geſture, the whole or its parts, to be drawn downwards, or towards the <hi>Pylorus:</hi> for there is need of ſuch a motion and of its tendencie, whereby the aliment ſwallowed down may be able to deſcend into the bottom of the Ventricle and there to be more ſtraitly preſſed, to be rolled from ſide to ſide, to be digeſted into Chyle, and at length to be tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Inteſtines. Therefore for theſe uſes the moving Fibres of either order being inflated by the gentle incurſion of the Spirits they eaſily compoſe the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle after that manner which the inſtinct of Nature ſuggeſts.</p>
                        <p>But if any Irritation happens to the nervous Fibres of the Stomach, whilſt the hurt is but ſmall and eaſily removed, the expulſive Contraction is begun rather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Pylorus</hi> than towards the Throat: but in Vomiting the Convulſion of the moving fibres beginning at the other ends of them, <hi>viz.</hi> the left ends, and ſtraitways becoming violent and impetuous compells the whole Cavity of the Stomach collected together, and greatly ſtraitned, to be drawn up, and to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuated that way.

                        <p>Therefore the next or conjunct cauſe of Vomiting is a ſudden and vehement Exploſion of the animal Spirits ſeated in the fleſhy Coat of the Ventricle, by which indeed they are very much irritated,<note place="margin">The Conjunct cauſe of Vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</note> and then expanſed, and rarefied, as they leap impetuouſly from all the tendinous Fibres, and then firſt and chiefly from thoſe that are placed near the Mouth of the Ventric<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

In the mean time it may be obſerved that the Spirits inhabiting the Fibres of the Stomach do exiſt in ſome more thick and firm, that they are not, unleſs by a more ſtrong irritation, agitated into an emetick Exploſion; but in others they are either more ſubtil, or too much elaſtick, that from a light occaſion they are incited to a vomitive Convulſion. Moreover when any thing hurtful or moleſting afflicts the fleſhy Fibres of the Stomach, a Convulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is excited in theſe towards the <hi>Pylorus,</hi> in others it is more readily carried to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Mouth of the Ventricle, and from thence either Vomiting or Purging proceeds.</p>
                        <p>As to what appertains to the more remote cauſes of Vomiting,<note place="margin">The more remote cauſes of Vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</note> of which num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber are whatſoever do much or grievouſly irritate the Spirits ſeated in the fleſhy Fibres of the Stomach: which truly happens to be done after very many ways, we ſhall reduce them to ſome certain Heads. And in the firſt place may be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red hither improportionate objects approaching the interior and nervous Coat of the Ventricle or rather the Spirits inhabiting it; for this being hauled, oftentimes provokes the other lying over it into emetick Convulſions. Theſe Provocatives are either taken in at the Mouth, to wit, diſagreeing Food, Medicines, or Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or elſe a Matter begotten in the Ventricle, or laſtly brought thither from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>far by the Arteries and the Nerves; or in the ſecond place the Spirits inhabiting the fleſhy Fibres of the Stomach are irritated by reaſon of ſome trouble from other Spirits at a diſtance inflicted here or there, and communicated from thence to the Ventricle by the Pipes of the Fibres or Nerves. Vomiting excited after the former manner, may be called the proper affection of the Ventricle, and this latter to be done by conſent. We ſhall note ſome Inſtances of all of theſe.</p>
                        <p>In the firſt place therefore an irritation made in the interior Tunicle,<note place="margin">Vomiting in reſpect of the Ventricle is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Idiopathick or Sympathick.</note> of the Ventricle provokes Vomiting before any other cauſe whatſoever.

Further in this Coat of the Stomach there ſeems to be placed ſome peculiar ſenſibleneſs, both as to the touch and to the taſte diſtinct from any other thing in the whole Body, For truly when Medicines, or ſome Aliments, as <hi>Stibium, Mercurius Vitae,</hi> the Flowers of Antimony, the Spawn of the Barbel, with many others being chewed in the Mouth, they have cauſed no trouble to the Senſe, but theſe being ſunk down into the Stomach, how cruelly do they irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate this Coat, and quickly ſtir up moſt grievous Convulſions. Moreover if any one ſhould ſwallow down, though unknown, a ſmall portion of diſagreeing Aliment by Antipathy, though it be never ſo ſmall, cover'd over with other Meats, and hid as it were with a Mask, it is known by the Stomach, and as if he were an Enemy entred clandeſtinly, he is immediatly by an excited force caſt out of doors. The emetick provocatives taken in at the Mouth are either Medicins,<note place="margin">The emetick Irritation.</note> the reaſons of whoſe actings ſhall be given hereafter, or Poyſons, which produce that effect, for as much as they being of an infeſtous nature, do at the firſt touch overthrow the Stomachal Spirits, and bring them as it were into a Furie, or in the third place Aliments of which there is enough commonly known,<note place="margin">The emetick Matter.</note> for if they offend in a manifeſt or occult quantity, or in quality, or in the manner of taking them, or are improportionate to the Stomach,<note place="margin">

Hence very often the Colick ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes as we have clearly enough ſhown: But truly I have obſerved in many (who have been obnoxious to convulſive Paſſions) after a ſhort Headach, with heavineſs, and Vertigo, that a vomiting affection hath followed: that they returned back by Vomit what they have daily taken in, without any notable impurity of the Stomach. The matter ſo poured forth by the Arteries or Nerves upon the Coat of the Stomach, ſo it be looſe and eaſily to be diſſipated, is quickly ſhaken off a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, ſo that the Affection ſoon paſſes away, but if it be more fixed and adhering more pertinaciouſly to them, yea ſometimes growing into Humours of various kinds it induces a daily vomiting diſpoſition, and not eaſily curable.</p>

Beſides theſe now mentioned ways in which an irritation is made in the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle it ſelf, or in its appendix, it ſometimes happens that the Stomach, guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and well enough of it ſelf, ſuffers through default of other parts ſeated at a great diſtance; which is not done by the great continuity of Fibres, but by the Paſſage or Commerce of the Nerves. For truly by the leading Pipe of theſe,<note place="margin">The cauſe of Vomiting ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the Head.</note> when that the Animal Spirits are diſturbed in one place, others dwelling afar off they receive the like irritations and fall into contractions: hence from a wound or grievous blow upon the Head, for as much as the Spirits within the <hi>Ence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalon</hi> being diſturbed; by the paſſage of the eighth pair of Nerves, they ſtir up the others reſiding in the Ventricle into the Convulſions, Vomiting frequently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows: for the ſame reaſon, ſome being in a Ship, or riding in a Coach are troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with huge Vomiting. The cauſe of which Sickneſs is not by any means (as ſome affirm) the agitation of the Humours; but truly the Animal Spirits in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting the Brain, being compelled into inordinate motions, they fall tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly upon the beginning of the Nerves, and by their leading Pipe ſtir up the emetick contractions of the Inwards. In the mean time the Matter caſt out by Vomiting, is mere choler, which is by reaſon of the former Convulſion powred forth by the Choler-carrying Veſſels; ſo far is it that it ſhould be the primary cauſe of Vomiting. Further when that the Stemms out of the Trunk of the ſame eighth pair of Nerves and the inferior Branches, diſturbed in the peculiar Inwards of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> are irritated into Convulſions,<note place="margin">In the remote parts of the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen.</hi>
                           </note> other Stemms however untouched do not unfrequently receive the like diſturbance, and they themſelves impart to

                        <p>Thus far of Vomiting in general, and of its ſubject, formal reaſon, cauſes and various manners of doing it, in which hath been ſhown, that this affection is allto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſtirred up by the Spirits inhabiting the fleſhy Coat of the Ventricle being highly provoked, and drawn by their acting into convulſive Exploſions, and they for the moſt part and chiefly into that ſort of contractive Motions, by reaſon of the troubleſom ſenſe impreſſed on the interior nervous Coat; beſides that thoſe irregularities of the Spirits ſo affected, by reaſon of the Spirits being diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in other places, do communicate by the continuity of the Fibres, or the Pipe of the Nerves,<note place="margin">How the emetick Medicines do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate.</note> their diſorder to the Ventricle. Theſe things being premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, it remains next that (as it was in the ſecond place propoſed) treating of vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Medicines, we do ſhew by what manner and by what ſort of ſtrife they ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in the Ventricle, and other parts of our Body.</p>
                        <p>Concerning theſe it is very obvious to conceive, that Vomits being taken in at the Mouth, and received into the Ventricle, do at the firſt irritate its interior nervous Coat, and preſs on it a ſenſe of the trouble, and afterwards by the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of this the over-lying fleſhy Coat is affected, and ſtirred up to excreto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry contractions for the caſting off this Grief. But truly as to the manner of irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and the ways of excretion, there are ſome differences, and the reaſons of them are not very manifeſt.</p>
                        <p>For firſt of all when that cathartick Medicines, being taken into the Stomach do provoke its fleſhy Fibres into exterior contractions, from whence comes it, that from theſe more often and rather Vomiting is ſtirred up, and from thoſe purging, not indifferently either?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Further concerning thoſe which for the moſt part and allmoſt conſtantly move Vomiting it is to be obſerved, a certain Energie either in the manifeſt reaſon of its working, to produce that effect, as when that which is taken is truly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful in taſte, in ſmell, or any other ſenſible quality, or that they offend in quantity; and moreover ſome Medicines, to be given, being more properly and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifically diſpoſed for Vomits, the emetick Virtue of which is altogether hid from our ſenſes, only it betrays it ſelf by manifeſt effects in the Stomach. The ſolutions of theſe will make very much to the well building up of Emetologie.</p>

                        <p>Antimonial Emeticks and other more ſtrong being taken into the Stomach, are not wont preſently (unleſs in ſuch who before-hand loth them) to irritate,<note place="margin">By what means they operate in the Ventricle.</note> or to give a ſenſe of their trouble; but afterwards ſometimes ſooner ſometimes later, a nauſeouſneſs and perturbation is perceived, then a contraction of the Stomach, and aſcending, with an opening of its Orifice and a leaping up of the <hi>Oeſophagus</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Throat follows; and preſently after Vomiting; this being done, theſe <hi>Viſcera</hi> ſink down, and for a little time are quiet: but a little while after the inquietude of the Stomach, and nauſeouſneſs and the aſcenſion of that, and of the Throat returns with Vomiting, and ſo the force of Vomiting, and ceaſing from it, are often repeated by turns, until this operation ceaſes, the ſtrength of the Medicine being wholly worn out.</p>
                        <p>At the beginning of Vomiting the Ventricle ſeems only to be contracted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and not to be hugely provoked. Afterwards,<note place="margin">And by what rite or manner they affect it.</note> its Convulſions are more vehement, and unfold themſelves more largely, ſo that the <hi>Duodenum</hi> by an inver<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted motion, directs its contractions upwards, and whatſoever is contained in the Stomach (which is the intent of the emetick irritation) pours forth: if the irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation be yet further ſtretch'd, there not only follows Convulſions, but often times diſtentions, and puffings up, and the more dangerous Convulſions of the Ventricle, to wit, a yexing or hickcock: and truly by reaſon of the animal Spirits being diſturbed in their whole <hi>Syſtaſit,</hi> and ſometimes too much diſſipated or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, frequent Swoonings, cold Sweats, and not ſeldom deadly Convulſions of the Members or of the whole Body happen.</p>

If the Vellication perſevere, the ſerous Humours are preſſed forth of the little Mouths of the Arteries and Nerves; then the Convulſion being communicated to the <hi>Duodenum</hi> by its Pipes, the Choler and pancreatick juice being extorted from the Paſſages, they are carried forth and ſpread into the Ventricle.

                        <p>As to the vulgar opinion, that Vomitory Medicines do agitate the Humours up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and ſift them out through the upper parts by a certain ſpecifick propertie, it
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40331:25"/> ſeems to be meerly frivolous; for of what ſort that Virtue ſhould be, none hath been able to explicate, nor indeed to prove that there is in truth any ſuch thing. In the mean time for the underſtanding of the Emetologie it will be enough to conceive that the particles of a Medicine very infeſtous to Nature being imbibed by the nervous Fibres of the interior Coat of the Stomach, do induce a great trouble to them; from thence that that Juice might ſuddenly and the neareſt way be expelled again, the fleſhy Fibres of the other Coat are irritated, and inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into Emetic Convulſions. But that indeed is urged by ſome, that white Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebore applyed to the Navel, and an infuſion of <hi>Crocus Metallorum</hi> given gliſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways doth move to Vomit, haveing often made the experiment I cannot find to be true. But if it ſhould be ſo ſometimes, why ſhould not a violent irritation inflicted on the Inteſtines, at the ſame time ſtir up Convulſions and inverted Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions, and afterwards ſecondarily and by conſent Vomiting in the Ventricle? (by the like way indeed, this affection of the Ventricle, comes oftentimes in the colick, and in the Iliac Paſſion) one time, I injected into the jugular Vein of a ſtrong Dog about ſix ounces of Wine impregnated with an infuſion of Antimony; about five or ſix minutes after he began to reel, and faulter in his going and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to Vomit extreamly. But we may ſuppoſe this effect to have been cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from the Medicine aſſaulting the Brain rather then the Stomach, when the like Vomiting follows after a Liniment or a Fomentation of the Juice or decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Tobacco applyed to the Head.</p>
                        <p>Neither is that opinion built upon leſs trifling Foundations and as we judge,<note place="margin">They operate not on peculiar Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours.</note> as far from the truth, which affirms certain vomitory Medicines to work upon cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, others on Flegm and others on Melancholy, and to bring away this or that Humour, ſearch'd out and as it were whole from the reſt. But about the choice to be made in Emeticks, the cheif regard of the difference to be obſerved is, that in ſome griefs the more gentle are to be adminiſtred,<note place="margin">From whence that vulgar Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror aroſe.</note> which diſturb nothing beyond the Ventricle, and do gently bring away only thoſe things which flow about its Cavity, or adhere to its Coats: in other caſes more ſtrong are convenient, that by a Convulſion communicated alſo to other <hi>viſcera,</hi> whatſoever excrements over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flows in them, or is heaped up any where elſe, may be moved out of the Mine, and preſently caſt forth a doors either upwards or downwards. And for that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a viſcous Matter and as it were Phlegmatic is cheifly ſifted forth, the cauſe is, for that the ballaſt of the Ventricle, the receptacle of the bilious Humour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unſhaken, is almoſt only purged out, but when the choler-carrying Veſſels are cleanſed, the excretion comes forth the moſt part bilious. The Vomiting of a black Humour depends very much upon the Tincture of the Medicine, for vitriolated Medicines infect the out caſt Matter with blackneſs.</p>
                        <p>Evacuation by Vomit as it is more violent than by Stool,<note place="margin">The emetick E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuation if it be convenient is more Efficacious than any other.</note> ſo if there be ſtrength to bear it, in ſome diſeaſes it is more profitable or helps more than ten purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For by this means heavie Phlegm growing in the Folds of the Stomach, which all the other Catharticks ſlide beſides, is purged away or cleanſed as with a Broom, beſides the neighbouring parts, the Pancreas, Meſenterie, Spleen, and Liver it ſelf are moved by its ſtrong Convulſion, ſo that obſtructions made in them alſo, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſtagnations there be of the Blood and Humours, are eaſily removed by this kind of Remedy. The extraneous Ferments begot every where in the Body, and alſo the more ſecret Seeds of Diſeaſes are rarely extirpated without the applying of vomitory Medicines; but chiefly in the Diſeaſes of the Brain and Nerves the uſe of Emeticks is eſteemed very helpful, for by this kind of evacuation, not only the Filth of the Stomach and the Inwards, which pollutes the Chyle and Blood, is plentifully cleanſed away, but alſo the Glandulas, which are the emunctories of the Blood, and nervous Juice, being placed in the <hi>viſcera</hi> are ſqueeſed. the Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler-leading Veſſels, and other receptacles of the Excrements are copiouſly evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for that the ſame being emptied they more readily receive the <hi>Serum</hi> and other Purges of either Humour, and the ſuperfluities otherwiſe apt to reſtagnate into the Head: moreover, when as the innumerable little Mouths of the Arteries un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the hairy Cruſt do open into the Ventricle, this being by a vomitory Medicine notably hauled, they pour forth what vitious or malignant Humours are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding in the Blood, and there by Vomit they are ſifted forth, and therefore it is chiefly for this reaſon difficult diſeaſes are beſt cured by Emeticks, and ſcarcely without them. For truly theſe Medicines ſhould be of an untamable and active
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40331:26"/> Nature, and not only ſqueez forth the ſuperfluous Humours from the maſs of the Blood by pulling and hauling the Arteries, but ſcatter abroad the Blood, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into the Pipes of the Veins, which there do gape and are innumerable, and do precipitate its ſeroſities and other excrements and cauſe them to ſeparate. But in the mean time this emetic Evacuation ought not to be uſed indifferently by all; For that in ſome the tone of the Ventricle is too lax and weak, and the conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo tender that the Spirits immediately become faint with vomitory Medicines, and looſe their ſtrength:<note place="margin">But more Dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</note> others again have <hi>Viſcera</hi> of an immoderate and perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious Senſation, that although they are very difficult to Vomit, yet having once begun Vomiting it is not eaſily allayed, but with the very often endeavouring to vomit, they are brought to a great loſs of their ſtrength and to a failing of their Spirits.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">The Indication of the vomitory Medicine.</note>Wherefore that the vomitory Medicine may be rightly exhibited, we ought to weigh, what are its Indications or Signs of the need of it, to whom to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and to whom to be prohibited. Emeticks ſeem to be needed, when the bilious and bitteriſh Humour fluctuates in the Ventricle, that from thence a nauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, an ingrateful ſavour, or ſhort Headach do ariſe, alſo if the Stomach be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened with a clammy Phlegm, as in the long diſeaſe of Maids, and in Men after Surfeting, and inordinate Eating. In moſt caſes when with difficulty of Breathing the Ventricle being full is affected with a Queaſineſs or Nauſcouſneſs, evacuation by purging is wont to be uſed. Further when the Stomach is preſſed with an extrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ferment that what ſoever is put into it is preſently caſt back again by Vomit, alſo by reaſon of far diſtant parts, Vomiting is not ſeldom uſed ſuccesfully: for by this means the Choler-carying Veſſels are very greatly emptied, that the Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler being plentifully powred forth from the Blood its feveriſh dyſcraſie may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away. Furthermore, for as much as the ſuperfluities or ſtagnations of the nervous Humour are moſt eaſily cured by the means of this evacuation; in the Gout, <hi>Aſthma,</hi> Epilepſie, Madneſs, and very many other Diſeaſes, which are accounted great and difficult, the uſe of Emeticks comes to be no ſmall means of curing. Secondly they permit the taking of this Remedie,<note place="margin">

Thirdly they prohibit an Emetick where there is a difficulty of Vomiting or an unaptneſs found by a former experience,<note place="margin">

                           <p>As to what belongs to the Aetiology of this Chymical proceſs, we ſay,<note place="margin">The Reaſon of both the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> whilſt theſe two Champions ſtriving together do mutually lay hold of and bruiſe one another, a third (and ſometimes a fourth) coming upon them; binds them: Whereby they are more ſtrictly complicated, and broken more minutely. But truly both the Gold by the Mercury, and both of them by the <hi>Menſtruums,</hi> are diſſolved and torn into little bits: then the Humidity being abſtracted, the ſaline Particles of the Metals are combined with the Salts of the <hi>Menſtruum.</hi> In the mean time the remaining metallick little bodies being caſt between and ſhut up within the pores of the Salts. But yet this Combination is not ſo ſtrict, but that the Metals by themſelves or either of them by Solution and Coagulation with its proper <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> may be reduced into precipitate: For indeed ſince that both the metallick Particles and the ſaline <hi>Menſtruums</hi> in that prepared Precipitate, are ſo many and ſo diverſe, all of them cannot be abſolutely united. Wherefore that matter (as I have often obſerved) is not but very hardly fixed, and to be reduced into a <hi>Calx</hi> proper for Medicine; for if for the drawing off the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> too ſtrong a heat be applied; the Mercury will aſcend, and the remaining Gold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume its proper Species: But if the Fire be more remiſs than it ought, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination of the Salts with the metallick Particles will not be ſtrict enough, but that it will be taken away with mere ablution; ſo that common Water being poured on the Precipitate, it ſhall wholly diſſolve it, and drink up the whole matter into it ſelf, and then the whole Work muſt be well nigh reiterated for to make the Medicine.</p>

                        <p>NAture being incited to a violent motion, oftentimes goes beyond its bounds, and runs forth beyond meaſure, ſo that there is ſometimes need of a ſtop or <hi>remora,</hi> whereby its violence might be ſtayed. This is plainly diſcerned in vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting, if at any time it be immoderate, through the operation of a medicine, or for any other occaſions; it therefore belongs as much to Medicine to allay this fury of the Stomach as to ſtir it up. How many ways, and for what cauſes Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting is wont to happen without taking an Emetick, we have already declared: Beſides it is obvious to common obſervation, that this evacuation provoked by Medicine is ſometimes ſo violent and ſo long, that unleſs it be ſtopped by the help of Art, Life it ſelf will be in manifeſt danger. Therefore as in the practice of Phyſick Emetick medicines are of neceſſary uſe;<note place="margin">Immoderate Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting proceeds either from an Emetick Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine or from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cauſes.</note> ſo ſometimes for the ſtopping that Excretion (as often as it ſhall be too much or preternatural) Remedies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the former, or Antidotes for Vomiting are made known. We will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the firſt place, ſhew how exceſſive Vomitings cauſed by an Emetick are cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: And then Secondly, by what means and remedies preternatural Vomiting, raiſed by reaſon of other Cauſes, may be helped.</p>
                        <p>As to the firſt, Vomiting raiſed by a medicine becomes more vehement and continues longer, becauſe the animal Spirits being irritated beyond meaſure and growing angry; their diſorders are not eaſily or preſently remitted, but that they thruſting forth themſelves do by frequent fits ſtir up violent Emetick Convulſions, and often repeat them. Moreover that exploſive Force begun in the Ventricle, is not ſeldom propagated to the Spirits inhabiting the neighbouring parts, and from thence to others, and at laſt ſometimes to their whole <hi>Syſtaſis,</hi> in ſo much that Torments and Convulſions in the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> afterwards in the Midriff, and laſtly in the whole Body with manifeſt danger of Life follow Vomiting.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">The Reaſons of the former are unfolded.</note>The Spirits are above meaſure irritated, either from the Medicine only by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the diſproportion of quality or quantity to them; or elſe from the other humours, as the like ſharp <hi>ſerum,</hi> and others being poured into the Ventricle in the time of Vomiting. Beſides in ſome the animal Spirits are ſo tender and Elaſtick,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40331:30"/> that from every Emetick irritation though very light, both thoſe inhabiting the Ventricle, and thoſe alſo which are near about are excited into Convulſive Explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Hence many erquiring from the Vomitory about the Milt, Paunch, and other inwards, impute the whole buſineſs to the Vapours ſtirred up by the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, when indeed it happens altogether by reaſon of the Animal Spirits being rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily too much moved, and hardly to be appeaſed.</p>
                        <p>If this overworking be cauſed by the Medicine, let the Patient,<note place="margin">Its Cure.</note> being preſently put to Bed, make uſe of both external and internal remedies: And firſt of all that the Lodgers in the Ventricle may be quieted; let there be adminiſtred either a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation warm, of the Decoction of Pontick Wormwood, Mint, and Spices in red Wine, or a Cake of a piece of bread toſted, and dipped in Claret Wine warmed, applied thereto. Let there be a Gliſter given of Milk with Treacle diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved therein: Let alſo warm Frictions of the members be uſed, and ſtrong Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures above the Knees which may drive away the Convulſions from thoſe parts. Let the Ventricle in the mean time be kept empty, unleſs ſwooning follows: But as ſoon as he may be able to take any thing of food or medicine, let him have ſome Cordial water or warm burnt wine. In very great perturbation, if the Pulſe admit it, Treacle Andromick, or <hi>Diaſcordium,</hi> alſo ſometimes a ſolution of <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danum</hi> or Opiatick Tinctures are convenient.</p>
                        <p>In preternatural Vomiting ſtirred up from other Cauſes,<note place="margin">Vomiting from other Cauſes is either Critick or Symptomatick.</note> we muſt conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther it be Critick or Judicial, or Symptomatick Signal. In the former there is nothing to be done ſuddenly or raſhly: that ſuperfluity whilſt they have ſtrength, may not be ſtop'd, but the going forth of the matter to be expelled is either to be facilitated or haſtned, or to be carried forth by ſome other way. Hence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing urged by a naufeouſneſs and ſtriving to vomit; it is convenient to give Poſſet-drink ſimple or with the leaves of <hi>Carduus</hi> boyled therein, alſo ſometimes <hi>Oxymel,</hi> and wine of Squills or Antimonial Wine. Sometimes Glyſters are uſed, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo a gentle purge carries away the matter, boyling in the Stomach by a more eaſie way of excluſion through the Inteſtines.</p>
                        <p n="2">(2.<note place="margin">The latter is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Idiopathick or Sympathick.</note>) In Symptomatick Vomiting a conjunct cauſe (as we have already intimated) either ſubſiſting in the Ventricle, produces that Idiopathick or proper Affection; or fixed in other parts ſtirs up their Convulſions, and a Communication being made by the Nerves, the Emetick perturbations in the Ventricle, as in the Nephritick Paroxyſms, Colicks, Hyſterick paſſions, Vertigo and many others uſe to happen, the healing of which ſort of Sympathick Vomiting, depends upon the cure of the primary Diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>When the Stomach is primarily affected, the Cauſe is,<note place="margin">When the Stomach is primarily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected what me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to be uſed.</note> that the Nervous Fibres irritated above meaſure, provoke the other motricious Fibres into excretory Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions. But theſe are irritated from an improportionate Object, <hi>viz.</hi> In as much as they are not able to thruſt forth to the Inteſtines or to overcome, or to digeſt rightly a certain matter which lies upon them, but are neceſſitated by exciting Vomiting to caſt it the ſooneſt way out of doors. That Matter beomes ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous or untamable by its own proper viciouſneſs, for as much as offending in quality or quantity it provokes the Nervous Fibres; or by the fault of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach it ſelf, becauſe that its tone is lax, and its Fibres becomes ſo weak, that they cannot be able to overcome or tolerate the Chyle it ſelf, much leſs the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementitious humours, but that being impatient of its burthen, they caſt forth whatſoever is contained within by Vomiting. As there are various cauſes of either of theſe, and manners of affecting, we will here ſhew ſome of the chief of them, together with the Remedies and the reaſons of the Cure.</p>
                        <p>The Emetick matter ſubſiſting in the Ventricle is either poured into it from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, or is begot there by reaſon of its depravity or want of Concoction: in either reſpect the preſent Ballaſt is firſt of all to be carried forth, then its more fruitful increaſe muſt be cut away, or provided againſt.</p>
                        <p>Therefore that the filthy <hi>Colluvies</hi> of the viſcous matter may be cleanſed out of the Ventricle, let there be preſcrib'd a gentle Vomit, of <hi>Carduus</hi> Poſſet-drink, or of <hi>Oxymel</hi> or Wine of Squills or of the decoction of the Flowers of Camo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil, or of the Roots of Agrimony with the ſolution of the Salt of Vitriol or ſuch like, then the Reliques may be gently carried off by Glyſters or Cat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40331:31"/> heaping up anon a new proviſion of incongruous Matter oftentimes flowing into the Ventricle either through the Arteries, or the Choler-carrying Veſſels, brings in an emetick Diſpoſition. Blood letting doth not rarely give help, and therefore the Vomitings of great bellied Women are frequently cured by this kind of Remedy. Beſides thoſe things are convenient which may attemper the Blood, whereby the leſs aduſt Excrements may be therein generated. Hence it is that Whey, the drinking of medicinal Waters, the Juice of Herbs, <hi>Sal Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nellae</hi> and ſuch like for as much as they ſcatter the Blood, and carry its Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to another place, they often take away the Vomitive Diſpoſition. Theſe kinds of remedies are likewiſe uſed if that frequent and daily Vomiting, proceeds (according to the opinion of ſome) from the meeting and wreſtling of the biliary and pancreatick Humours, and their regurgitation into the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle.</p>
                        <p>The frequent Vomiting and the hardeſt to be cured is that which proceeds from an incongruous Matter begot within the Ventricle, and from thence becomes Emetick, for as much certainly as by reaſon of the vitiated Ferment of this <hi>Viſcus,</hi> whatſoever is eaten, degenerates into an irritative putrefaction.

                           <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of Purging and of purging Medicines.</head>
                        <p>PUrging ſeems to be an Affection contrary to Vomiting, or rather inverted; for truly in this and in that, they run from the Priſons of the ſame Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle, to a divers Goal.<note place="margin">Purging in an affection contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or inverſe to Vomiting.</note> For even as in Vomiting the interior fleſhy Fibres of the Stomach being inflated by the ſudden running in of the Spirits into their left Ends, and ſo being contracted they make its bottom and ſides to be drawn together, and to be brought upwards towards the left Orifice, to the end that its Contents may be carried forth above: ſo in purging, the ſame fleſhy Fibres being in like manner inflated at their right ends, and contracted, they cauſe the whole circumference of the Stomach to be gathered together, and to be inclined towards the <hi>Pylorus,</hi> that the Excrement may paſs away by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Parts. As the excretory Motion begun from the Ventricle is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Oeſophagus,</hi> ſo it is in purging by the Inteſtines, and either of them is propagated by the fleſhy Fibres from part to part to the end. In either affection the motion of the Stomach is violent, and after a manner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive, ſo that ſometimes either is changed into the other. For purging being too much haſtned from a ſharp Provocative, oftentimes cauſes Vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: in like manner purging of the Belly follows from an emetick Medicine: the reaſon of which is, becauſe the animal Spirits being vehemently irritated, and thruſt forth, they leap diverſely ſometimes into theſe and ſometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe ends of the fleſhy Fibres; almoſt after the ſame manner as if you ſhould too much urge a generous Horſe with your Spurrs, you will force him ſometimes to run forward, and ſometimes to leap backward.</p>
                        <p>Therefore Purging is an excretorie Motion in the Ventricle,<note place="margin">Its Deſcription.</note> and in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines, by reaſon of their fleſhy Fibres being ſwiftly and orderly contracted quicker and faſter whereby the Chyle and its <hi>Faeces,</hi> both the recrements of the Humours, or the Corruptions there begotten, or pour'd in from another Part, may be thruſt on from one part unto another until they be caſt forth a doors at the Fundament as thorow a Sink. For the Ventricle being irritated by the prickings of the Cathartick, contracting it ſelf quicker and more ſtraitly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Pylorus,</hi> pours forth whatſoever it cheriſhes in its Boſom, into the <hi>Duodenum;</hi> and the Inteſtines being pulled together, they reiterate greater and more frequent excretorie Spaſms, by which moſt of the Contents before heaped up in their Cavities, or attracted, or expreſſed at that time, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. Alſo Purging is that ſort of violent and conſtrained Excretion, which Nature being quiet performs at leaſure and at times; in ſuch Nature being provoked, acts not without tumult and a certain perturbation. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for the more perfect knowledge of Purgation it ſeems requiſite, that firſt of all we ſhould ſhew what are the Contents of the Ventricle and the Inteſtines, both their proper, and thoſe ſuggeſted from another place, which are wont to be ſent forth by Stool. Then theſe being effected, it will be reaſon to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate by what means, and by what ſtrife purging Medicines do perform their Operations.<note place="margin">The Contents of the Ventricle and the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines which purging Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">2. <hi>Wind.</hi>
                           </note>Beſides theſe kind of Contents there is yet another reſulting from theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Winds, which are wont to be ſtirred up within the Stomach, and the Cavities of the Inteſtines more than in any other part of the whole Body, and ſeem to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced after this manner: Whilſt that the Aliments being conſtrained in the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, and digeſted, are diſſolved by their ferments and heat; very many <hi>Effluvia</hi> come from them, which if they might obtain an open and free ſpace, would va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh away going into the Air, but they being ſhut up within a membrane, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together; they conſtitute in heap of Vapours as it were wind: which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes blows up and diſtends the Inteſtines,<note place="margin">How winds are begotten within the Cavities of the Bowels.</note> and which, way being given, ruſhing out, moves along with it excretions: But being ſhut up creates torments, and not rarely an inflation of the belly. Winds ariſing from the diſſolving of the Aliments in the Bowels, are begot after ſuch like manner, as when Pearls, Corals, or other Concretes being put into a Matrace are diſſolved by their <hi>Menſtrua:</hi> For very many vapours ariſe from their ſolutions, which if they are ſtraitly kept in, will enforce the Veſſel that contains them to fly or break to pieces. In like manner from the diſſolution or concoction, or fermentation of the Aliment within the firſt paſſages, very copious <hi>Efflavia</hi> ariſe; which being gathered together and ſhut up within the Membranes become wind: to whoſe more plentiful increaſe ſome other cauſes do contribute. For the colluctation and efferveſcency of Juices not rightly mixed do notably perform this: For that whilſt the adventitious humours, or heterogeneous things heaped together, and chiefly Medicaments do ferment with the other contents of the Inteſtines, from the mutual refraction of Particles very many little bodies proceeding, they are gathered together into a Vapour. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over from the blood it ſelf bubling up, when as a copious breath every where flows out, ſome part of it breaking forth from the Arteries into the cavities of the <hi>Viſcera</hi> doth there increaſe the produced heap of Blaſts. But further yet, the extenſions of the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> and their Convulſive Intumeſcencies, add to the more plentiful heap of Winds: For whilſt the Membranes by reaſon of the exploſions of the Spirits,<note place="margin">Blaſts are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Cauſe and ſometimes effects of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions in the <hi>Viſcera.</hi>
                           </note> and their inordinate excurſions, are very much diſtended; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Cavity as a blown up bladder is much enlarged, by reaſon that a portion of the included humour within that vacuity, as it were a Cucurbit after the fire is out, is rarefied into wind; which afterwards when the ſtiffneſs of the Membrane gives way, breaks forth with a force, or paſſes through the neareſt windings of the Inteſtines tumultuouſly.<note place="margin">After what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the winds in Cramps are wont to be begotten.</note> For this reaſon, when any part of the Inteſtine by an inflammation, or falling down of ſharp humours, ſhall be obnoxious to convulſive ſtretchings forth, alſo Winds continually brought forth become very troubleſom. When I have opened the dead bodies of many dying of an inflammation in the <hi>Colon;</hi> I found in all of them their whole Inteſtines diſtended to the utmoſt, and as it were blown up with Wind: Which without doubt happened, not becauſe the Wind firſt begotten had diſtended thoſe <hi>Viſcera;</hi> but when from the ſpirits of the Membrane greatly irritated, and thruſt forth among their Fibres, they ſhould be very much diſtended; therefore thoſe Blaſts were begotten to fill up the <hi>Vacuum,</hi> and ſo by conſequence ſecondarily. From this cauſe we have formerly intimated the Tympany to ariſe, as, in another place, perhaps we ſhall ſometime or other more largely declare. As therefore there is wont to be a very plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſtore of Winds in the Stone or Gravel, in the Colical, Hypocondriacal, and Hyſterical paſſions, they are not, as 'tis commonly thought, me cauſes of thoſe Diſeaſes, but only the effects. Indeed whilſt by the Paroxyſms of thoſe Membranes the irregular extenſive Affections ariſe, and that the hollow <hi>Viſcera</hi> do ſwell up by the Spirits violently running forth, from hence preſently, that the empty ſpace may be filled, a certain humidity being ſhut up, is reſolved into vapours, from which the blaſts ariſe. Wherefore when the diſtention of the affected part is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxed,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40331:33"/> the Wind ſo ſuddenly produced is driven to ſome other place, by the falling down of the Membranes.

Whereby theſe things may be the better affected, Nature gives to the Inteſtines an almoſt conſtant, and as it were, ſolemn excretory motion, and conſtitutes various incitements or provocatives to that motion.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. As to the firſt, the excretory motion of the Inteſtines, as of the Ventricle,<note place="margin">By what Fibres it is effected.</note> is effected altogether by the fleſhy Fibres, compoſing the middle Coat of either of the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> and we have taken notice of a double order or <hi>ſeries</hi> of them in the whole paſſage of the Chyle, to wit, from the <hi>Oeſophagus</hi> to the ſtreight Inteſtine. The exterior order indeed of the inteſtinal Fibres, are ſtretched in length through all thoſe <hi>Viſcera,</hi> and ſtrait upon the whole ſuperficies; but the interior <hi>ſeries</hi> or order, conſiſts in circular Fibres compaſſing about on every ſide, as it were ſet thick with little Rings, the pipes of the Inteſtines; as it is repreſented in the third figure of the ſame Table. The Fibres of either kind being contracted together, do ſtraiten the Cavities of thoſe Inteſtines through all their dimenſions: which whilſt it is done ſucceſſively and by one order after another, and as it were by jumps, there is a neceſſity that whatſoever is therein contained, ſhould gently and even creepingly be carried along, the forepart being even thruſt forward by the following part. This ſort of motion of the Inteſtines is commonly called Vermicular, becauſe it is continued from one part to another as in a creeping Worm; and is continually acted according to the uſe and needs of Nature more or leſs, without alſo our knowing of it; becauſe indeed theſe <hi>Viſcera</hi> ought to move away their burthen very leiſurely: But leſt that ſometimes they ſhould, being i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, deſiſt from this task, they are urged as occaſion ſerves by divers provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catives.</p>
                        <p>For in the firſt place the heap it ſelf of the Chyle and the <hi>Faeces;</hi>

When by this means the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the Belly being leiſurely one part after another thruſt forward, do deſcend near to the end of the <hi>Colon,</hi> becauſe then the muſculous part of the right Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine feels a preſſing; therefore the voluntary comes in the room of the natural Motion, whereby the <hi>Sphincter</hi> of the Arſe-hole being opened, and the Muſcles of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> being compreſſed, the Excrements are caſt forth of the doors. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the Organs of Reſpiration do contribute ſomething to this excretory motion of the Inteſtines, for that indeed they perpetually drawing here and there up and down the inferior Belly, whilſt they ſo ſhake its contents, they make them to move gently forward.</p>
                        <p>Beſides the aforeſaid irritation, by which the fleſhy Fibres by the inſtinct of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and by an ordinary way are provoked into frequent and almoſt continual Vermiculations, there happen yet ſome other provocatives and various incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which conſtrain or haſten as occaſion is offered, thoſe excretory Contracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and not ſeldom compel them into compulſive; ſo that the Belly is forced to caſt out its contents haſtily and impetuouſly, as if they were provoked by a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thartick. But theſe intrinſick irritaments of the Belly are in the firſt place incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40331:34"/> or immoderate food, Corruptions of degenerate Chyle, plentiful excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Blood and nervous Juice, or ſharp overflowings out of the Glandula's and other Emunctories of the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> and chiefly from the receptacle of the Gall and Pipe of the Pancreas,<note place="margin">To which happen many accidents of other things.</note> as alſo ſeroſities, or ſuperfluous humours or incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous flowing from the Blood and from the ſtock of the Nerves, and from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward diſpoſition of the Body. Concerning the chief of theſe, becauſe they ariſe oftentimes in purging, and do intend the operation of the Medicine, we will ſpeak ſpecially and briefly.</p>

Yea by reaſon of want of digeſtion, ſometimes alſo through obſtructions in the Meſentery or inteſtinal Pipe, by reaſon of too much viſcouſneſs ſticking upon the glaudulous Coat or mouths of the Veſſels, that hinders the diſtribution of the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricious Juice, and therefore the whole matter almoſt of things eaten, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the firſt paſſages, produces frequent and plentiful Stools.</p>

                        <p n="3">3. An excremental matter from a yet more remote Region, to wit, either from the maſs of the Blood,<note place="margin">

For in the aforeſaid parts and places, and chiefly in the bloody Maſs, the degenerate or ſuperfluous humours ariſing up, when they are not eaſily or ſufficiently to be ſent away by evaporation or piſſing, ofttimes a <hi>Metaſtaſis</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made within; they overflow thickly every where from the gaping mouths of the inteſtinal Veſſels, cauſing very frequent and watry Stools. And truly ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Blood it ſelf, being vitiated into a thickneſs and apt to coagulate; when it cannot be circulated readily through theſe ſmall Veſſels, frequently breaks forth in great abundance, and cauſes a dyſentery or bloody Flux. But it is to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, when the exterior Pores are ſhut up by cold, or the skinny tumours do ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly vaniſh, a flux of the Belly ſucceeds. I have known many obnoxious to a conſtipation of the Belly, to have been cured by this kind of Remedy only; to wit, that they aroſe from Bed betimes in the morning, an hour ſooner than they were wont. For how much the accuſtomed perſpiration is leſſened, ſo much is added to make ſlippery the Belly. Theſe things being thus premiſed concerning the various Contents of the Inteſtines, both thoſe inbred and acceſſory; and alſo concerning the excretory motion of theſe Inwards, both natural and ordinary and both violent and conſtrain'd, alſo concerning the various provocatives or irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, by which the Belly by the accord of Nature is wont to be moderately looſed or more inordinately diſturbed: It will be eaſie to ſhew by what means, and by what kind of ſtrife purging Medicines do move the Ventricle and Inteſtines to excretions, and cauſe their contents to be carried forth, now theſe, now thoſe apart,<note place="margin">How Cathar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Contents of the ſame <hi>Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cera.</hi>

                        <p>When purging Medicines are taken in a liquid form, they are already enough prepared for the work, but if they conſiſt of a ſolid ſubſtance, being taken into the Ventricle and diſſolved by its ferment and imbued; they make, as it were, a tincture which becomes a Cathartick;<note place="margin">By what means theſe do work in a liquid form and how in a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid.</note> purging after the ſame manner as the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, according to the following means and reaſon. It ſeems that this kind of liquor, being firſt of all ſhut up in the Ventricle, and afterwards in the Inteſtines, by and by imbues the hairy filaments of the interior Coat with the Glandula's, and whilſt it adheres cloſely to them,<note place="margin">By what order now on theſe parts now on thoſe.</note> its Particles enter into the nervous Fibres, and both ſanguiferous and Chyliferous Veſſels, and irritate every one of theſe and alſo the Choler-bearing Pore and pipe of the Pancreas to make them render their
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40331:34"/> Contents, and as it were to ſpue them forth. In the mean time the nervous Fibres of the interior Coat are hauled partly by the imbibed Medicine, and partly by the Humours preſſed forth into its Cavity, the fleſhy Fibres of the ſuperior Coat begin the Excretorie Convulſions, whereby that which is trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom might be removed. By what means theſe are done firſt in the Ventricle, and then ſucceſſively in the parts and in what parts of the Inteſtines, and what ſort of Humours are picked forth in the whole Paſſage, we will a little more accurately conſider.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. As to the Stomach it ſeems to be done after this manner following,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>1.</hi> What their action is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Ventricle.</note> 
                           <hi>viz.</hi> The Cathartick Tincture being diffuſed within the Stomach, it firſt of all imbues the hairy Raggs of the inward Coat, and adhering very cloſely to them, from thence it is delivered to the nervous Fibres, entring into which and quickly filling them even to ſaturity, at length it begins to irritate them; who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore preſently wringling themſelves endeavour to put away the imbibed Liquor together with its proper Juice, and the viſcous Phlegm laid up in the folds of the Stomach. Further certain other Particles of the ſame Medicine, while it ſtays in the Stomach, enter into the Mouths of the Veſſels, and <hi>Glandulas,</hi> and pull them, and cauſe the Seroſities in them and other Humours to be wrung forth, and emulged.<note place="margin">To wit, in the firſt place they move the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Fibres in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Senſe of the Trouble, then the moving Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres into Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Convulſions.</note> And whilſt that the Bottom of the Stomach and the nervous Fibres are ſo grieved and provoked by theſe kind of troubleſom Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, the fleſhy Fibres being ſtirred up into excretory Contractions, they draw together the bottom and ſides of the Stomach upwards and incline them towards the <hi>Pylorus;</hi> that its loading with the medicinal Tincture might be caſt forth adoors, and be tranſmitted to the Inteſtines. After that the Stomach for a little while obtains a ſedation and quiet reſt, until that the nervous Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres drinking in a new proviſion from part of the ſame Tincture ſticking ſtill to the hary Filaments are again irritated; and ſo as a new loading is moved and expreſſed into the hollowneſs of the Stomach, the fleſhy Fibres repeat again the excretory Convulſions for its caſting forth, and this is ſo acted by turns until the Poyſon of the Medicine be wholly purged, and wiped clean away from the hairie Raggs, and that the Spirits inhabiting the Fibres lay aſide their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; which ſometimes quickly and eaſily ſucceeds, ſo that after an Hour or two the Stomach is free from any trouble impreſſed by the Medicine, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining perturbation being altogether tranſlated to the Inteſtinal Region. But yet it very often happens, from a Cathartick being taken, that ſhort but very ſharp Vomitings are excited, and nevertheleſs though the Medicine be caſt up, that a Purging plentiful enough follows. The reaſon of which is, for that too great and violent an irritation being made at the beginning, it ſtirr'd up more ſtrong, that is, emetick Convulſions; then after that the force of that ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritament was leſſened or broken, the contractions became more gentle and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thartick. For truly, the Virtue of a purging Medicine and of a Vomit, and the manner of their Working, differ not ſo much as to their ſpecifick quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as chiefly in this reſpect,<note place="margin">Whence the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent change of theſe Motions proceed.</note> that the trouble given by the irritation of that is more eaſily and longer to be tollerated, that it may at length be tranſmitted to the Inteſtines, but not that which is excited by an Emetick. But that ſometimes Vomiting ariſes, after the operation plentifully made by Stool, the cauſe ſeems to be, that the Tincture of the Medicine, being more deeply imbibed by the hairy Coat, is not eaſily wiped off; wherefore after very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny purgative Endeavours had in vain, at length an Emetick Convulſion is ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up for the thorowly ſhaking it off. It is a uſual thing for the Stomach before it be emptied by a Medicine, to be ſtirred up to Vomit by things taken in with notable nauſeouſneſs and trouble, becauſe indeed the Chyle by reaſon of an hindred or depraved Concoction degenerates into an incongruous and irritative putrefaction. But that the moſt part of the purging Medicine ſlides away too ſoon out of the Ventricle, and without clenſiing away its fliths, ſpending its greateſt ſtrength within the inteſtinal Pipes: by what means this is done we will ſee next.</p>
                        <p>The Cathartick Tincture being thruſt forth of the Stomach,<note place="margin">The operation of the Carhartick within the <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odenum</hi> and ſmall Gute.</note> and carying with it from thence a certain excrementitious matter, ſlides into the Inteſtines; where it imbues preſently in the paſſage of the <hi>Duodenum</hi> and the ſuperior <hi>Ili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> the Filaments or Raggs of the hairy Coat, and ſticks cloſely to them: then

Hence when the ſuperior Region of the Inteſtinal Pipe is provoked into frequent and ſtrong Vermiculations, whereby the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents might be driven further off, that motion of Excretion being begun is propagated to the reſt of the Inteſtines, and thoſe together being ſtimulated by the Contents of the Superior being thruſt forth into their Cavities, fall into excretory Convulſions one after another, untill the <hi>Faeces</hi> of the Belly which ſtay laſt of all be thruſt forth of Door, others and then others coming in their places. The Cathartick Tincture as if infeſted with Spirits, irritates the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Fibres (as it hath been ſhown) into Corrugations, and dolorous extenſions oftentimes, and the fleſhy Fibres into Excretory Convulſions: then for as much as the ſame begins to ferment with the Humours, and the Contents of the Inteſtines, an Ebullition being made within their Cavities, and Blaſts ſtirred up, it variouſly blows up, and diſtends the conteining Membranes, and ſo cauſes the unloading of the Belly with wringing pains and with a noyſe.</p>

                        <p>As we have already noted three degrees of the humoral <hi>Diarrhoea</hi> or natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Cathartick, ſo now it ſeems beſt, that we conſtitute ſo many ſpecies or Claſſes of medicinal Purgation.<note place="margin">Three degrees of Cathartick Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</note> The firſt of theſe is when by reaſon that the nervous Fibres of the Inteſtines being gently provoked, the fleſhy Fibres being contracted more ſtraitly and more often a little above their wonted manner, they move forward their more looſe Contents, more ſwiftly from one part to another, and at length gently caſt them out of Doors. In the ſecond ſpecies of Purgation, ſome Humours beſides, being wrung forth from the biliarie Pore, the Pipe of the <hi>Pancreas</hi> and the Mouths of Veſſels hauled by the Medicine, are thruſt forth together with the <hi>Faeces</hi> of the Belly. In the third theſe Pipes being more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently provoked, they pour forth into the Cavities of the Inteſtines a great plenty of every kind of Humour, and further a recrementitious matter both from the Blood, ſcattered, and precipitated by reaſon of the admitted Particles of the Medicine, and by conſequence alſo from the nervous Juice, and other Parts, is purged forth being carried by the Arteries to the Inteſtines.</p>
                        <p>I think it appears plain enough by theſe that a Cathartick acts only by irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,<note place="margin">Catharticks do not operate by Attraction or Election.</note> fermentation and expulſion and not (as is commonly ſaid) by Attracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; nor does it indeed become a reaſonable Philoſopher nor any that hath the uſe of ratiocination to affirm any Medicines by reaſon of ſimilitude of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, or I know not what Specifick Virtues to act upon any determinate Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and to carry it whole and by it ſelf out a Doors. But that ſometimes Choler, Phlegm Matter, <hi>Serum</hi> or Melancholy is judged to be ſeparated apart one from another, that ſeems to be ſo done, either becauſe Medicines do irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate in the <hi>Viſcera</hi> after a diverſe manner, or they ferment with the Blood and other Humours by various means, or laſtly they put the Tincture in the Stools themſelves. It will be worth our while that we ſhew ſome reaſons and inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of every one of theſe.</p>
                        <p>Firſt therefore, Medicines do irritate within the Cavities of the <hi>Viſcera</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a divers manner according as they contain more volatile or fixed Particles, more gentle, or more eager, more ſoft or more aſper, and for that cauſe ſtir up now in theſe places now in thoſe ſooner and rather more light or ſtronger Excretory Convulſions.

Further, other Catharticks as <hi>Jalap, Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cynthida, Elaterium</hi> and certain preparations of Mercury conſiſt of more ſharp and not ſeldom as it were maturating Particles; wherefore the which being received by the Inteſtines, and from thence tranſmitted to the Blood, notably diſperſe its Maſs, and precipitate it very much into ſeroſity: Yea ſometimes they as it were poyſon and corrupt its <hi>Craſis,</hi> or natural Complexion. Then indeed at the ſame time in which the Blood is ſcattered abroad, there is a vellication in the Inteſtines, and the ſerous excrements of the Blood, and its corruptions and melted fats are ſpewed forth into the cavities of thoſe <hi>Viſcera,</hi> from the mouths of the Arteries there opened; and ſo they induce very watry Stools. If that after the Blood ſo ſcattered abroad by the Medicine, and hurt in its natural Complexion, a little or no plentiful evacuation follows by Stool; the Blood being even more depraved by the incongruous mixture and corruptions, acquires from thence either a notable Dyſcraſie, or pouring forth its recrements and corruptions into the habit of the Body, cauſes puſtula's and watry bladders to break forth in the skin. For ſo from a greatly uſed Evacuation inconveniently made,<note place="margin">The evils of Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian or ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Purging.</note> oftentimes great evils follow: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it for nothing that the common people are ſo afraid, if at any time the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine ſhould work but little, leſt the Virulency contracted and left from thence, ſhould lye hid a long time after in the Body, and at length produce malignant Diſeaſes: For ſometimes from ſuch an occaſion as it were leprous paſſions or alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the ſenſes are ſtirred up; ſo not long ſince when as a Cathartick Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (and as it ſeems Mercurial) was exhibited by an Emperick to two Sons of a certain Oxfordian,<note place="margin">Shown in a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Hiſtory.</note> one of them was purged in the ſpace of forty eight hours a hundred times at leaſt, with great torment and ſwooning away of the Spirits: In the mean time the other being a little older had no Stool, but within a few days his Hair fell off, his Nails grew black, and moreover in a ſhort time after watry Puſtulaes broke forth through his whole Body, which growing hard into a cruſty Scab, and then falling off, preſently new ones ſprung up again: This kind of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, by reaſon of the complexion of the Blood highly vitiated, and as it were, poyſoned, yielding to no remedies, exerciſed moſt grievouſly this poor Wretch, above two years before it could be perfectly cured. Not only from Mercurial Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, but ſometimes from other Catharticks taken from the family of Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, the Maſs of the Blood is ſo depraved, that it cannot be reſtored or renewed but in a long time after: So that <hi>Helmont</hi> doth not altogether vndeſervedly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniate, ſaying cathartick Medicines do not always or only bring away the

Further the diverſe conſtitution of the Body, and diſpoſition of humours produces divers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of Excrements. Becauſe when the Choler-carrying Veſſels ſwell with Byle in theſe, the Salts of the vitriolick Tincture in theſe, being black Parents are houſed in the firſt paſſages; and in other places through the ill means of living, very many ſeroſities are heaped up in the whole Body, wherefore when theſe kind of Stools follow from any medicine whatſoever, if that theſe humours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called Cholerick or derived from the Choler, thoſe from the heat of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy or theſe watry happen to be purged, ſuch are affirmed to be picked forth by the elective Medicament. What therefore belongs to the choice to be had in purging Medicines, notwithſtanding that thoſe cryed up claſſes of Medicines ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to this or that juice, do not pleaſe; yet we think that any Catharticks in all caſes are not indifferently to be uſurped, but that it is the work of the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a prudent Phyſician, and of a ſagacious diſcerning, that according to the ſtrength, temperament, the ability or tenuity of the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> bearing, cuſtom and imagination of the Patients; yea, according to the nature, time, and condition of the Diſeaſe, that a purgation gentler or ſtronger, from hot or temperate things gentle or more ſharp, in ſolid ſubſtance or liquid, or ſome other of another kind or form, be preſcribed.</p>
                        <p>The more ancient Phyſicians, with whom alſo many Neotericks agree,<note place="margin">The preparation of the humours not neceſſary to purging.</note> did or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain a previous preparation of the humours for elective Purgation, as neceſſary to it: Wherefore in their practical Books as often as cathartick Evacuation is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, a long <hi>ſeries</hi> of deſtinated preparations for eyery humour, in a ſolemn manner as it were with a certain pomp is propoſed; the uſe of which though ſpecious enough ſeems not to be profitable; becauſe in truth there are no ſuch humours, as we ſhall ſhew clearly in another place. But truly as a purge is not convenient at any time, nor in any ſtate of Body, that you may go about it rightly;<note place="margin">What preparation is required for purging.</note> both op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity and a certain preparation is required, and both theſe reſpect the firſt paſſages and the ſanguinious Maſs.</p>

                        <p>But as to what belongs to the Blood, Purging is oftentimes unſeaſonable,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>2.</hi> In reſpect of the Blood.</note> and ſometimes alſo incongruous; but in neither of theſe caſes are the ordinary prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations convenient, but only Alteratives: Becauſe not theſe imaginary humours are to be diſpoſed for evacuation, but the Blood it ſelf ought to be reduced either from its troubled and confuſed ſtate, to a quiet Condition; or from a Debility or Dyſcraſie to a ſtrong and equal temperament. Whilſt that the Blood feavouriſhly boyling is diſturbed in its mixture, a Purge is always conceived to be hurtful; and therefore condemned by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and the Ancients: No leſs are thoſe Evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons forbid whilſt its Maſs being languid and weak, doth not ariſe to due fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Further, when the Blood is above meaſure bilous or watry, or is too much inclined either to Coagulations or Fuſions, Purgings and ſuch kind of drainings, do not move away its depravation, but oftentimes augment it. But in theſe caſes alterative Remedies are rather preſcribed, which may deſtroy the wicked Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations or elſe the Separations of the Salts, Sulphur, and <hi>Serum,</hi> and take away their enormities: But concerning theſe Medicines of cathartick Evacuation, either previous, or which is often better, theſe ſupplying its turn, <hi>viz.</hi> Digeſtives and Alteratives, we ſpeak of them ſpecially hereafter.</p>
                        <p>There do not occur many more things to be ſpoken concerning the Theory
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:40331:37"/> of purging Medicines, beſides truly (as appears by what has been already ſaid) Catharticks irritate both the Spirits inhabiting the ſplanchnick Fibres, to wit, theſe into troubleſome Senſions or Feelings, and therefore the others into excretory Contractions,<note place="margin">A double faculty or virtue of a Cathartick; ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentative.</note> further ferment both the humours and the Blood, and compel them into various fuſions and ſeparations of Parts: It reſts that we enquire upon what kind of Particles, whether elementary or ſecondary, and (as I may ſo ſay) Qualita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, this double Virtue both irritative and fermentative depends. Concerning theſe in general we obſerve,<note place="margin">By what elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Particles either of them depends.</note> which afterwards ſhall be confirmed by inſtances, the irritative force which uſes to ſhew it ſelf in the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> and by whoſe inſtinct the cathartick Convulſions are provoked by no means to proceed from the principles of the Medicine either ſpiritual, watry, or earthly Particles, neither from the Saline or Sulphureous alone by themſelves,<note place="margin">The irritative doth not proceed from Spirit, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Earth.</note> but to ariſe from them always combined, and ſometimes with others joyned to them. For although Salt and Sulphur are the chief Inſtruments of cathartick Irritation, yet neither of them ſimple uſes to be ſo infeſtous to the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> as that it ſhould ſtir up the moving Fibres into Excretory Convulſions,<note place="margin">Nor from Salt or Sulphur alone.</note> but they conjoyned together, do mutually exalt one another, and inforce into little prickings, yea acquire an inimical, and indeed an untameable diſpoſition to our Body.<note place="margin">But from them combined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> The tincture of Antimony, alſo its Ceruſs brings no trouble to the Stomach, but are rather grateful, and Cordials. But the Crocus of Metals, <hi>Stibium,</hi> the butter of Antimony, and others prepared out of Sulphur and ſalt conjoyned become Emeticks or great and ſtrong Catharticks. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner we ſomewhere obſerve the ſaline and ſulphureous Particles ſeparated one from another, and by themſelves, to be grateful enough in ſmell and taſte, but thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intimately commixt preſently to attract a Fetor and rammiſhneſs.</p>
                        <p>But as to what reſpects the Cathartick Fermentation, it doth not ſo plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear whether indeed the ſame Particles which irritate the Spirits into Excretory Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions,<note place="margin">On what kind of Particles the fermentative vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue depends.</note> do alſo ſcatter the blood, and make it to ſeparate into parts, ſo that they may caſt forth its Excrements into the Cavities of the <hi>Viſcera</hi> from the mouths of the Arteries. Truly the Blood even as milk is for the moſt part ſcattered and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated into ſeroſities only by acid things; as ſhall be hereafter largely declared by experiments and reaſons. The Alcale ſalts fixed and volatile and alſo Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous do not diſſolve the Mixtion of the Blood, but rather preſerves it whole, and being ſoluted reſtore it; and in like manner do the Spirits of Wine and other moſt pure Sulphureans: But let the acid ſalt only be wanting to promote the Cathartick, the purging force of Medicines may be broken, or wholly taken a way by nothing more.</p>
                        <p>Therefore that we may give our judgement concerning purging Medicines, exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation being made by the ſenſe, it ſeems moſt likely, that they imbued (being for the moſt part of a ſharp taſte and ſomewhat pungitive) with a certain volatile and ſharp ſalt, together with Sulphur, (which ſalt in the more ſtrong is as it were Septick or Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefactive) but theſe their ſulphureous ſaline particles do not ſcatter the Blood by means of the acid or other precipitatory ſalts, for as much as whilſt they embrace more intimately and friendly certain parts of it, they ſnatch them away from their other companions, and bind them to themſelves; but on the contrary the Cathartick Particles being incongruous to the whole bloody Maſs,<note place="margin">The Cathartick force of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine from Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, we call a latile Salt, and as it were pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefactive.</note> and to all its Particles, and as they are immiſcible and untameable, they agitate all thoſe with their confuſion, and ſtir them up to an expurgative effervency; which, there being preſently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a more quick pulſe of the Heart, is not quieted before all Heterogeneous Bodies be caſt out of doors, a certain portion of the ſerous Humour wherewith they are mixed being expulſed with them and ſometimes other excrements of the blood. The bloody Maſs being infected after the like manner by the Particles of a ſtrong Cathartick growes hot, even as generous Wines, heterogeneous things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing caſt into the But, are ſaid to ferment anew, for the excluſion of that incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thing, ſo that ſometimes they boyl up within the Cask, until that either the Veſſel be broken, or that their Complexion be thorowly vitiated. But this doth not ſo frequently happen to the bloody Liquor, becauſe both the incongruous Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Cathartick, and others of the Blood vitiated and ſeparated by them,<note place="margin">The more ſtrong Catharticks work by ſtool e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as <hi>Cantha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides</hi> by the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine.</note> caſt out by the Arteries and ſcattered on every ſide, and eſpecially more wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opening, into the Cavities of the Inteſtines.

Further, that from the ſame Salts congealing the ſaline Particles of the Mercury, and hiding themſelves within its other Pores, the colour like Snow is produced, and together that by reaſon of the little ſuperficies of the ſame Salts being highly ſharpned, the Corroſive Force doth proceed. Then that by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated ſublimated Sublimation afterwards, the Quickſilver being added and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated almoſt in an equal Quantity, that acritude may be taken away; the reaſon is for that the ſaline Particles are ſo bruiſed and broken by the Mercurial Particles, being increaſed in abundance, and every where growing to them; that they do not dig and lance the ſenſible Fibres as before: Beſides the powder of this Sublimate being bruiſed in a Mortar grows yellow, by reaſon of the plenty of the Mercury, as it were, emerging. But that the common precipitate, in which the mercurial Particles are greater than the congealed Salts, is highly corroſive, the reaſon is, becauſe the little Bodies of the Fire make ſharp all mineral Particles, in as much as they take away all their ſoftneſſes, and ſtick cloſe to them with their exceeding ſharp pricking Bodies.</p>

The doſe of its Powder is <hi>gr.</hi> vj to xij or xiiij.</p>
                           <p>In this Preparation the ſpirit of Wine draws out the ſulphureous Particles of that Concrete, and that the more eaſily,<note place="margin">The reaſon of its preparation.</note> for as much as theſe in the mixtion were before ſeparated of themſelves and gathered together, as might be gathered from its reſinous and bright ſhining Veins; whilſt that the ſulphureous part is drawn forth, ſome of the ſaline Stems alſo joyned with it: Wherefore this Reſine ſtinking, and ſharp in taſte, purges ſtrongly and becomes eaſily inflammable. This works in a leſſer quantity, and ſtronger than in the whole mixture it ſelf, for as much as all the active Particles, the blunt ones being done away, do grow together.</p>

                        <p>THere is equally need of a Bridle as well as of Spurs no leſs about the right orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Purging than of Vomiting: For as ſometimes Cathartick Medicines are of neceſſary uſe to make ſlippery the Belly, or to cauſe plentiful going to the Stool; ſo if that evacuation be immoderate, or ſhall not be eaſily tollerable, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Remedies or Antidotes of the <hi>Diarrhoea</hi> or Dyſenterick Affection are to be preſcribed. By what means and after what manner of affecting purgers do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their operations, alſo for what cauſes beſides, and occaſions, ſpontaneous Purgings do frequently happen, is already ſhown.

                           <note place="margin">The reaſon of the Medicinal <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percatharſis.</hi>
                           </note>A purging Medicine being improportionate either in quality or quantity, works more ſtrongly and longer, and for as much as by irritating too much the nervous
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:40331:40"/> Fibres, the animal Spirits are agitated into excandeſcencies or angers not eaſily to be allayed, and for as much as it ſcatters the blood and the humours, and as it were melts them, therefore that their liquifications might be thruſt down into the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities of the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> yet greater excretory irritations are made.</p>
                        <p>The Therapeutick Method hath reſpect both to the precaution or prevention and curation of the <hi>Hypercatharſis</hi> or exceſſive Purging. As to the firſt there is need of conſideration and caution before evacuation in its operation, and after its ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. For in the firſt place,<note place="margin">Its precaution. <hi>1.</hi> Before Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation.</note> it very much behoves to weigh both the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſtrength, and cuſtom of the Body to be purged, as alſo the nature, doſe, manner of working, and ordinary effects of the Medicine to be given; then to proportionate by collected marks the vertue of the Agent according to the bearing of the patient. Secondly whilſt that the Medicine operates,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>2.</hi> In its opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> the <hi>Viſcera</hi> of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, the Blood and animal Spirits ſhould be kept free from any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation. Wherefore in that time neither any groſs aliments, nor viſcous, nor many which may trouble the Belly, ſhould be taken in; all External Cold whereby the Pores of the Body are ſhut up, ſhould be carefully ſhunned; laſtly the Mind ſhould be pleaſing, even and ſerene, and free from Cares, and more hard Studies. Thirdly the operation of the Medicine being finiſhed,<note place="margin">3. <hi>Afterwards.</hi>
                           </note> the Excandeſcency of the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits ought to be quieted, and the Efferveſcencie of the Blood and Humours to be appeaſed; for which end an anodine Medicine, or a gentle Hypnotick or cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing reſt is given according to the following Forms.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Water of Cowſlip Flowers ℥ij of Barly Cinnamon water, Syrop of Poppies, of each ℥ſs, of Pearls ℈ſs, make a draught to be taken going to reſt. or</p>

                        <p>If that theſe things being omitted, or notwithſtanding all this Caution,<note place="margin">The Cure of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive purging.</note> that an exceſſive purging by reaſon of the Medicine ſhould happen, preſently let the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient be put into a warm Bed and handled after this following Method. In the firſt place let there be applyed to the Ventricle and to the region of the whole <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pigaſtrium</hi> or Belly, a plaiſter made out of the Treacle, or foment it with warm Linnen ſtoops dipped in the Decoction of Wormwood, Mints, with Spices and red Wine, and ſo wrung out: then let him take a Bole of Treacle Andromach. or it being diſſolved in Cinnamon water. Moreover let him drink now and then a ſpoonful or two of burnt Wine with Mint water therein. If troubled with the wringing of the Gutts, let a Gliſter of warm Milk with Treacle diſſolved therein, be given: and ſometimes they ought to apply warm frictions to the exterior Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and Ligatures, where by the Blood may be brought outward, and be detai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from too great a Colliquation, and effuſion into the Cavities of the <hi>Viſcera:</hi> then in the evening, if that there be ſtrength and that the Pulſe appears robuſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, let a doſe of <hi>Diacodium,</hi> or <hi>Laudanum</hi> in ſome fit Vehicle be taken.</p>
                        <p>As to the other kinds of too much Purging, which,<note place="margin">What is to be done in the Symptomes of the <hi>Diarrhoea.</hi>
                           </note> without a Cathartick being given are wont to ariſe from various Cauſes and occaſions, they require a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine; I ſay for the moſt part they be merely Symptomaticks of and depend upon other Diſeaſes, and the Method of their cure is the ſame as of thoſe Diſeaſes themſelves from whence they ſpring. So indeed in the Scorbute and Phthiſick it is uſual for the Diſeaſed to be troubled with a frequent Flux of the Belly: the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of curing doth not reſpect this Symptom, but the cauſe of the primarie ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be done away. But yet ſometimes the Flux of the Belly (which is wont to be called the <hi>Diarrhaea,</hi> or Dyſenterie) ſeems a diſeaſe of it ſelf; and truly in this City of London, ſince this kind of Diſeaſe is wont to reign almoſt every Year, and is commonly eſteemed peculiar to the place, this place will be very fit, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a little further into its Nature, Cauſes, and method of curing it.</p>
                        <p>Although the word <hi>Dyſenteria</hi> in common acceptation denotes the bloody Flux of the Belly as well as the humoral Lask. 1 yet ſaving the Etymologie,<note place="margin">The <hi>London</hi> Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenterie.</note> it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to apply this Name to the <hi>London</hi> Diſeaſe alſo when it is not bloody. For I have often, and for a long while, obſerved this kind of Flux, which is wont to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt us every Year about Autumn for the moſt part, commonly called the wring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Belly or (according to our Speech) the Griping of the Gutts, to be of two far different kinds; in the one the Stools are watry,<note place="margin">Two kinds of it <hi>viz.</hi> watry and bloody.</note> and as it were clear with a ſudden failing of ſtrength, but the other bloody, yet they are tollerable;
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:40331:41"/> in the mean time bilous or phlegmatick Stools (whilſt either of the diſeaſes raged) very rarely happen, and denote the Diſeaſe to be not of ſo ill a condition. By which, both theſe Dyſenterical Diſeaſes are known clearly one from another, as to their Differences, Cauſes, and formal Reaſons, it will be to the purpoſe to ſhew here Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of either of theſe, obſerved then by me, and plainly deſcribed in thoſe years when they were peculiar.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">A deſcription of the former.</note>In the Year 1670 about the <hi>Autumnal Aequinox</hi> very many laboured with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloody Dyſenterie, but very cruel and very dangerous. The diſeaſe invading ſuddenly and frequently without any manifeſt occaſion, did reduce thoſe labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with it, by great Vomiting, frequent and watry Stools, quickly to a very great debility, to horrid failure of the Spirits, and loſs of all their ſtrength. I knew ſome the day before well enough and very ſtrong, in twelve hours ſpace ſo miſerably caſt down by the Tyranny of this Diſeaſe, that with a weak and ſmall Pulſe, cold Sweat, ſhort and quick Breath, they ſeemed juſt ready to dye: and truly not a few to whom fit Remedies or opportunity of cure were wanting, were ſuddenly killed by it. This ſickneſs raging for a whole month began to decreaſe about the middle of <hi>October,</hi> and before the beginning of <hi>November</hi> was almoſt wholly vaniſhed. Very few in that time had bloody ſtools, and not many Bilous but very many had Vomits, and watrie, almoſt clear and plentiful Stools, whilſt that popular Dyſenterie raged ſo cruelly in the City, in the Country or at leaſt three miles beyond the City, almoſt none was ſick of it. Beſides here, although very many were ſick, the diſeaſe did not ſeem to be propagated by Contagion, but to affect thoſe only that were prediſpoſed. For it did not take thoſe who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant in the ſame Family with the ſick any ſooner, than thoſe who ſhun'd their Houſes.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Its Cure.</note>For the Cure of this Diſeaſe no Evacuation did help, yea Phlebotomie, Vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and purging ſometimes did hurt; but for the moſt part, the remedies were only Cordials, and thoſe the moſt hot, to wit, abounding in Spirits, and Sulphur or volatile Salt, that were beneficial; inſomuch as the Spirits of Wine with Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar a little burnt became as it were the epidemical popular remedy, and in ſuch a Dyſenterie for the moſt part profitable, although in the other bloody Flux, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently uſed, oftentimes was found hurtful. The method of curing which I happily adminiſtred to very many then, and alſo am wont ſtill in the like Caſe, was according to the following manner.</p>
                        <p>Take of Treacle Andromach. <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>j, or <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>iſs, in your Bed drink after it of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Julep 7 or 8 Spoonfuls,<note place="margin">Bole.</note> and repeat it every third, fourth or fifth hour.</p>

                           <note place="margin">Opiates.</note>In the Evening if the Pulſe and breathing ſhall be ſtrong enough give him to drink in a little draught of Plague Water, of liquid <hi>Laudanum</hi> prepared with Juice of Quinces, <hi>gr.</hi> xx.</p>

                           <note place="margin">The reaſon of this Diſeaſe.</note>Let us enquire now concerning the reaſon of this particular Diſeaſe, what is its chief conjunct Cauſe, to wit, what kind of peccant Humour that is to be purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:40331:41"/> out, that ſhould ſo infeſt the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> and ſhould irritate them into excretory Convulſions with torments, Perturbation of the whole Body, and ſudden fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure of all their ſtrength. Certainly none will think this, Choler, or pancreatick Juice, or what elſe you will to be begotten within the inteſtinal Pipes: neither do we believe it indeed from the meer Blood, (as ſometimes happens in the <hi>Criſis</hi> of Fevours poured forth into the <hi>Viſcera.</hi> But rather we ſuſpect (as by the ſudden Languor and ſoon falling down of the Spirits, and enervation of all the parts it will be lawful to conjecture) in this diſeaſe the more noble Juices of the Body, to wit, the nervous and nutricious placed in the ſolid parts to be wholly vitiated from their natural Complexion; and diſſolved and ſpread abroad as it were a ſtream, and to overflow into the bloody Maſs; then preſently from it (they being indeed incongruous and immiſcible, and unapt to be ſent away by urine or by tranſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) to be transferred towards the Stomach, and Inteſtines by the Celiack Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and there flowing forth from the thick planted little mouths of the Arteries, to ſtir up theſe horrid dyſenterical Symptoms. Further it ſeems that together the Blood it ſelf being ſcattered abroad by the flood of the other humours, is melted with them, and being looſened in its complexion, its meltings do burſt forth with the other excrements into the Cavities of the <hi>Viſcera.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Certainly all the moving Fibres with the fainting away of the whole Soul on a ſudden can proceed from no other Cauſe, but that the humour actuating them,<note place="margin">It ariſes chiefly from the vitiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Liquor,</note> and in which the animal Spirits dwell, leaving them wholly, doth ſlow forth; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we ſuppoſe it to flow forth, for as much as it being vitiated in its complexion, and growing ſower like milk doth moleſt the conteining Parts, and irritate them into wrinkles whereby it may be ſhaken off.

For truly I have often obſerved (which alſo hapned this Year) after an exceeding hot and dry Summer, in the Autumn Epidemick and irregular Fevours to have hapned in many places of <hi>England,</hi> and at the ſame time very few Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doners to have fallen ſick of that Fevour, but very many of the dyſenterick Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe: the reaſon of which ſeems to be, that when our Bodies by reaſon of the foregoing Intemperateneſs of the Summer, are diſpoſed to autumnal Fevours, they are rather determined, in this thick and ſmoaky Air into this kind of Diſeaſe.<note place="margin">Its antecedent cauſes are <hi>1.</hi> The thickneſs of the <hi>London</hi> Air.</note> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that tranſpiration being hindred, the corruptions of the degenerate humours, being unable to be carried forth thorow the Pores of the skin, overflow within, and there burſting forth from all the Arteries together, they cauſe theſe horrid af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the <hi>Viſcera.</hi>

Beſides in ſome years this mutation is impreſſed chiefly on the Blood, and in others rather upon the nervous Liquor. By reaſon of the former, for the moſt part autumnal or ſharp continual, or cruel intermitting Fevours do follow; in reſpect of the other ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular Fevours, and if an ill condition do ariſe; in which without any great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caleſcency of the Blood, or <hi>criſis</hi> of the Diſeaſe, very dangerous affections of the Brain and nervous ſtock do happen.

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:40331:42"/> the grave. From the firſt invaſion of this Diſeaſe, Blood copiouſly and often was caſt forth, and for the moſt part with grief, and pains of the belly; pertina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious watchings with a fevour, and huge thirſt were wont to trouble them, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their ſtrength remained indifferently, ſo as the diſeaſed, after being about a week ſick, and going almoſt twenty times a day to ſtool were able to riſe out of their Beds. Theſe bloody ſtools although they ſeemed terrible, yet the ſick did not quickly die, but did perſiſt many weeks, yea ſometimes months daily voyding blood, and in a great abundance; and at length, if the diſeaſe growing worſe and worſe did tend towards an ill end, before death, other ſymptoms, and chiefly wakings, a ſcurf of the mouth and Tongue, thirſt and ſometimes dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ulceratious did appear, yea theſe ſymptoms breaking forth ſooner than the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly flux; and ſooner than its due reſtraint did ſhew a great danger of death.

It now remains that we inquire a little into the Aetiologie of this Epidemick or rather peculiar Diſeaſe.</p>
                           <p>
                              <note place="margin">Shewing the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe.</note>It appears plain enough, by what hath been ſaid, that as the unbloody dyſentery doth not, ſo neither doth the bloody flux proceed from the mere more ſharp con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the Inteſtine. Further as that other diſeaſe ſeems to have had its original from the flood of the degenerate nervous Liquor, and nervous juice; ſo this chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the corruption and vice of the Blood; and therefore even as of that, a ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſickneſs in another place was contemporary with the peculiar evill of this place, ſo when the bloody dyſentery afflicted the Londoners, an intermitting tertian Fevour (as it is deſcribed by the Phyſicians) infeſted in like manner the reſt of <hi>England.</hi> And indeed, tis plane to be conceived that, when as the blood being roaſted with the Summer heats, therefore would be apt about Autumn for immoderate fevouriſh efferveſcencies, and like wines made warm, for fermentations whereby they might be purged, if it cannot ſend away its degenerate and to be purged Particles by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the perſpiration being hindred in the more thick Air, the ordinary way by evaporation, for that it is yet hot, it transfers them towards the Inteſtines, and indeavours to caſt them out there by the more open mouths of the thick ſet Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. But indeed the incongruous excrements of the degenerate Blood, or the <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſum inquinamentum</hi> being more thorowly boyled into it, and intimately confuſed, not eaſily to be extricated or ſifted forth, wherefore it being big and burthened with this loading, whilſt in its circulating it paſſes thorow the ſmaller veſſels, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes very much ſtraitned, and therefore, about the internal ſuperficies of the Inteſtines where the Coats of the Arteries are thinner, the blood there ſwelling up, together by reaſon of the heterogeneous Particles with which it is full, being made thick and apt to coagulate, it eaſily breaks forth; and when it cannot ſift out and put off its Excrements alone; pours forth with them greatly infeſtous and por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it ſelf.</p>

                              <note place="margin">Three things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe.</note>Therefore for the exciting this popular dyſentery, theſe three things muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur: <hi>viz.</hi> there muſt be a dyſcraſy or evil diſpoſition of the ſanguineous Maſs, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſen thorow the intemperateneſs of the year whereby it is very prone to fall into fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouriſh efferveſcencies, of its own accord or occaſionally. Wherefore whilſt this Diſeaſe is wont to rage at <hi>London,</hi> an irregular Fevour did the like in moſt other places. Secondly the Excrements and corruptions of the ſo boyling blood and degenerate in its complexion, are ſo confounded, and intimately boyled into it, that they cannot neither be eaſily ſifted forth, nor ſuddenly caſt out either by ſweat or urine. Wherefore we have obſerved the Fevour contemporary and even continual with this dyſentery to have been moſt difficult to paſs judgement on, and its Paroxyſms ſcarce ever to have ended in a fevouriſh diſtemper. Thirdly, a conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the Pores is to be added to theſe (which determinate the aforeſaid diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions into the bloody Flux) being cauſed by a ſmoaky, thick conſtitution of the Air: For this directs the efferveſcency of the Blood toward the Inteſtines, where when its Filth or excrements cannot be ſifted forth, and not eaſily ſeparate from the remaining Maſs of Liquor, the Blood ſpontaneouſly flows forth it ſelf, in highly infected portions, and therefore apt to run.</p>

                              <note place="margin">This Diſeaſe is either gentle or malignant.</note>By reaſon of this kind of Proviſion the ordinary <hi>London</hi> dyſentery, and not very malignant, is wont to ariſe; which, although in reſpect of its bloody ſtools it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes preſently horrid, and for the moſt part of long continuance, yet it is not very contagious or more often deadly. But moreover this Diſeaſe ſometimes vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulent and as it were peſtilential, kills many, and largely ſhews its miaſm or defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by contagion. Further, in ſuch a condition the portions of the Blood, being touched with a certain malignity begin to be broken as in the peſt, and which ought to be ſifted forth and caſt out, from the remaining Maſs, leſt the whole be preſently
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:40331:43"/> overpowred; which indeed being more thick and therefore apt to be purged forth rather by the Belly than by the habit of the Body or by Urine, they are carried into the Coats of the Inteſtines by the Pipe of the Meſenterick and Caeliack Artery; where when they cannot eaſily go away from the remaining Blood, breaking forth partly from the Veſſels, they cauſe bloody ſtools, and partly being fixed in the membrane of the Inteſtines they bring forth in them a Phlegmon or inflammation of the blood or ulcerous diſpoſition, and ſometimes alſo a ſphacelous or mortified ulceration; and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly killing.</p>

                              </note> and the other by proper <hi>Alexipharmicks</hi> or Preſervatives. Secondly as to what has reſpect to the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> the troubleſome ſenſe of the nervous Fibres, and the ſtirring up of the fleſhy to Excretory convulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ought to be appeaſed, and the mouths of the Veſſels, leſt they power forth the blood and humour into the inteſtinal Pipes, ought to be ſhut up. The firſt of theſe Opiates, and the other Styptick or binding remedies uſe to affect: Beſides theſe it is behoveful to heal the greatly urging Symptoms and evil Affections that are wont to happen to this diſeaſe, the chief of which are a Fevour, with Thirſt, and wak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, torments of the Inteſtines, and ſometimes gnawing, inflammation and ulcers of them.</p>
                           <p>I ſhall not inſiſt upon theſe primary Indications ſingly and ſucceſſively, but I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract them together, and ſpeak of them at once.

                        <p>WE have ſome time ſince largely enough ſet forth the Original of the Urine, and its compoſition whilſt it was either a part or an excrement of the Blood, its Offices and manner of Separation. But we ſhall here further note,<note place="margin">The near kin of the <hi>Diureſis</hi> and the <hi>Diaphore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> with one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</note> that this hath a certain affinity with ſweat, that, and not ſeldom, they change their courſes, and the matter of the one is conveyed forth adoors by the emunctories of the other: For that the cutaneous Emanations if they are ſtrong and impetuous; ſnatch along with them much of the ſerous liquor deſtinated for the Reins, and transfer it into ſweat: Alſo on the other ſide, when by a copious afflux the <hi>ſerum</hi> is caſt forth by the Reins, it brings inwardly very many little bodies that are wont to exhale by the Skin, and involving them in its torrent, ſends them away by the urinary paſſages. Hence it comes to paſs, that Diaphoretick and Diuretick Medicines, are of a very near alike uſe, and ſometimes reciprocal: By either of them being taken, the maſs of the Blood is ſcattered abroad or precipitated, at leaſt it is compelled to ſeparate into parts, for that the <hi>ſerum</hi> drawn away from the reſt of the Blood, may be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven forth adoors by the more eaſie way which ſhall be granted.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">What the matter of the Urine is, and from whence it comes.</note>Although the immediate matter of the Urine flows only from the Blood, and is carried by the only paſſage of the emulging Arteries to the Ureters, yet oftentimes mediately that is wont to have manifold ſprings, and indeed divers, which for the moſt part may be diſtinguiſhed by a threefold conſideration, <hi>viz.</hi> It is ſtale or mere excrement,<note place="margin">It is threefold.</note> and is the watry part of the Blood growing ſtale, which being circulated with it for ſome time, acquires from the incocted ſaline and ſulphureous Particles a lixivial Tincture. Or Secondly, it is that <hi>Dilutum</hi> or ſteeped Liquor, of the yet crude Chyle, which indeed is poured abroad or ſuffufed in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance with the Blood, and being ſeparated again from it before it is dyed with the Tincture, cauſes an Urine plainly limpid, or clear. Thirdly and laſtly, the matter of the Urine oftentimes is a certain water, for the moſt part ſuffuſed or poured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad from the Blood, or as it were diſtilled into the ſolid parts, glandula's and Pipes of the <hi>Lymphae</hi> or water carriers, which being plentifully laid up together, and then of its own accord or ſome occaſion being given, gathering together a Flood, and dropping forth from its receptacles by the limphaeducts, it is carried back into the veins; from whence by a ſwift paſſage, paſſing through the Blood untouched; it is thruſt down by the Arteries into the Reins; and for that the Particles of Salt and Sulphur are not incocted or boyled into this, by reaſon of its ſhort ſtay in the Blood, from thence a Urine alſo limpid or clear is produced. The Urine of men in health, for the moſt part does participate after a ſort of each of theſe, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the matter exceeds in this or that together, the Urine appears more or leſs or not at all tinged. The <hi>ſerum</hi> coming from every part, and being mixed with the Blood, is ſeparated again from it in the circulation in divers places but chiefly in the Reins: For that the Blood bubling up within the Arteries, and being very much ra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>refied, whereby being ſeparated from thence it might paſs into the Veins; there is a neceſſity that it ſhould put off its ſeroſities and divert them to ſome other place.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:40331:46"/> As this is performed every where through the whole body, ſo more copiouſly and after a certain peculiar manner in the Reins.</p>
                        <p>But though it be commonly enough known that the ſeparation of the <hi>ſerum</hi> is made in this place, yet it is very much controverted by what means it is done,<note place="margin">How the <hi>ſerum</hi> is ſeparated from the Blood with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Reins.</note> whilſt theſe affirm the ſerous liquor to be drawn to the Reins, to be there only ſtrained thorow; and others believe a certain ferment to be eſtabliſhed in the Reins, by whoſe inſpiration the <hi>ſerum</hi> of the Blood, as that of Milk, is ſcattered and precipitated by a ſharp coagulation; and the odor, and the rank and ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſavour of this <hi>Viſcus</hi> ſeems after a ſort to argue that the thing is ſo. Before that we can certainly determine any thing of the virtues of Medicines which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke Urine, and their manner of operating; it will be neceſſary to unfold this doubt; what is performed in the Reins by the accuſtomed means of Nature, and what in the ſanguineous Maſs, for the ſeparation of the <hi>ſerum.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And firſt of all there is no need of proving the <hi>ſerum</hi> not to be drawn to the Reins among Philoſophers,<note place="margin">The <hi>ſerum</hi> is not drawn to the Reins.</note> when that of late ſimilar attraction has begun to be wholly exploded by moſt <hi>Virtuoſo</hi>'s, and all local motion is affirmed to be made on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by impulſe. And indeed, what has regard to the preſent buſineſs, by whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever things the circulation of the Blood is made known, it alſo plainly appears, that as the Blood ſo the <hi>ſerum</hi> being an inſeparable Companion within its Veſſels, is driven forward by the mere motion or impulſe of the Heart to the Reins. But whether it be there ſeparated by percolation or ſtraining only, or alſo by a certain precipitation, we muſt, that it may plainly appear, a little more accurately inquire or ſearch into the Anatomy and uſe of the Reins.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the ſtructure and uſe of the Reins, as divers both ancient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Authors have publiſhed various things,<note place="margin">The Structure of the Reins and</note> the moſt famous <hi>Bellinus</hi> hath the moſt accurately ſhewed their Anatomy. Indeed every one hath ſhewed plainly the Blood to be carried to the Reins by the emulgent Arteries, and to be carried back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain by the Veins: This the Laws and Inſpection of ſanguineous Circulation mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly declare, but in what places, through what Pipes, and by what workmanſhip the <hi>ſerum</hi> in the Reins is ſeparated from the Blood, and thruſt away into the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver; lay hid a long while from the moſt diligent ſearchers, until the aforeſaid Author by an happy invention, diſcovered the ſubſtance of the Reins to be neither Parenchymous, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe. </seg>
                           </label> (clotted or congealed bloody ſubſtance) as the Liver and Spleen or Milt; nor fleſhy Fibres, as the Heart and Bodies of the Muſcles, but an heap of membraneous little hollow Pipes, and by theſe ſo very ſmall paſſages the <hi>ſerum</hi> being delated from the circumference of the Reins towards their Centre, to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled forth into the Receiver: For as much as the emulgent Artery being divided into greater Branches, then into leſſer, and at length into very ſmall ſhoots, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys the Blood on every ſide to the utmoſt ſuperficies of the Reins; but here when growing hot and rarefied, it ſweats forth from the mouths of the Veſſels, whilſt the bloody part is received by the Veins to be returned back, the ſerous part is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuated into the very narrow pores of the little hollow Pipes impervious to the Blood, and flowing through their Pipes on every ſide towards the Receiver, it is thruſt down into a papillary ſubſtance, out of which it leiſurely diſtills into the Receiver.</p>
                        <p>By this it appears that the <hi>ſerum</hi> is ſeparated from the Blood, by a certain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colation in the Reins:<note place="margin">The <hi>ſerum</hi> is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the Blood by a ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning within the Reins.</note> Indeed after the like manner as when the ſame is thruſt forth of the Arteries every where into the Glandula's, for the matter of Tears, of Spittle, of the droppings of the Noſe, and of other Excretions. But further, it is to be thought, that this alſo is done as it were by the fuſion of the Blood, for that the Blood being of its own nature clammy, and apt to be coagulated whilſt that it paſſes through the Reins, it is very much ſcattered and attenuated by a lixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial ferment of this part; becauſe that the ſerous water may ſeparate more eaſily from it: For indeed Piſs or Stale being imbued with ſaltneſs, whilſt that it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually waſhes thorow the paſſages of the Reins, affixes to them ſaline Particles,<note place="margin">The Reins are ſtrong as it were with ferment.</note> and from thence infects it with a ſtrong ſmell or with a certain lixivial beſmearing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by whilſt the Blood paſſing through thoſe <hi>Viſcera</hi> is inſpired, it is preſerved conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually fluid from curdling, and apt to ſeparate into parts in the ſtraining, even as alſo Milk is defended from Coagulation by ſalt of Tartar infuſed. Yea Blood it ſelf when ſent forth from its Veſſel, is wont preſently to curdle and to be coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by reaſon of a ſolution of ſalt of Tartar or Armoniack being thereon poured,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:40331:47"/> remains fluid: Therefore a real Ferment doth not, as is commonly beleeved, precipitate the Blood, but defends it from ſuch a condition, whereby it may be it ſelf more freely circulated, and its <hi>Serum</hi> may be ſeparated in due quantity by ſtraining. And truly it is plane enough, that the Reins are imbued with ſuch a lixivial ferment in eating them being cook'd, which are by reaſon thereof of a very rank and ungrateful both taſt and ſmell.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Part of the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricious juice is ſent away toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> thorow the Reins.</note>Whilſt that the <hi>Serum</hi> is ſeparated after this manner in the Reins partly by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colation and partly by fuſion, not only the bloody part, but alſo the nutritious as to the greateſt portion of it, paſſing thorow the very narrow Pores of that ſtrainer, is carried back with the Blood by the Veins; in the mean time the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous liquor, being imbued with a ſaltneſs both in the ſanguinious Maſs, and by the ferment of the Reins, perpetually ſlides down by the urinary Pipes into the Receiver, and waſhes away, and carries with it a certain tenuous and more elaborated part of the nouriſhing juice, which is the <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> or reſidence of healthful urine.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">The matter of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine proceeds chiefly from the Blood.</note>But truly Stale or the matter of Urine as to its ſubſtance, quantity, and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, proceeds chiefly from the bloody Maſs. For that, as this, hath three chief offices, as we have ſhewn elſe where, to wit, an accenſion or inkindling for to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain the vital flame, an Inſtillation of the animal ſpirits into the Brain, and a diſtribution of the nutriment unto all pars; by reaſon of all and each of thoſe, there is a neceſſity that it ſhould be moiſtned with a great deal of watry humour, and ſhould be continually rinſed with freſh, and the old ſtill ſhould be ſent away, and that this ſhould be done in a due and conſtant manner, is of great moment for the conſervation of Health.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">The <hi>ſerum</hi> is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the blood ſometimes too hardly, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times too eaſily.</note>The freſh ſerous Liquor is introduced into the Blood, together with the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing juice by an eaſie labour, and is for the moſt part thorowly mingled with it without any obſtacle; but yet the old doth not always ſo readily and truly go away from it as need requires; but is wanting after divers ways about its excretion, and from thence the occaſion of very many diſeaſes ariſe. For truly the <hi>Serum</hi> ſometimes ſticks more unſeaſonably to the Blood, and will not extricate it ſelf from its em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces, as in Fevours evilly, and not thorowly as 'tis judged, alſo in the phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Dropſie, and Cacochymy or ill digeſtion. But that ſometimes although expulſed by the Blood, the reins relinquiſhing it (which is its chief way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion) is diverted to ſome other place, as in Catarrh's, gouty or ſcorbutical flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xions, alſo in every dropſie: Sometimes alſo on the contrary, the <hi>ſerum</hi> paſſing away too ſoon from the fellowſhip of the Blood, before it hath performed its task flies away, and ſupping up the portions of the more profitable humours, ſnatches them away with it ſelf, as in the <hi>Diabetes</hi> or piſſing Evil, and in great floods of Urine which ſometimes happen, and by and by ceaſe again. In theſe kind of caſes as often as the quantity of Urine is either too much defective or too much abounds, the Reins are not always or chiefly in the fault, but the Brain, and rather the Blood, for that its Maſs now too ſtrict and compacted, does not eaſily ſend away the <hi>ſerum,</hi> and other contents to be purged forth, now to lax and apt to be ſcattered abroad, doth not contain long enough both the <hi>ſerum</hi> and nouriſhing juice: Concerning which cauſes and the means whereby ſuch irregularities happen, we will a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inquire.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">The reaſon of this is beſt unfolded by the fuſion, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulation and reduction of Milk.</note>And indeed the analogy of the Blood with milk, (which we have in another place more largely unfolded, and ſhall here briefly touch upon) conduces very much to the ſolving of this knot. You muſt know that Milk whilſt that its mixture is kept whole, although it be warm or boyl upon the Fire; all its Particles being promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly temperated, do keep the Liquor uniform: But if any acid thing be put thereto hot, preſently the more thick Particles grow thicker into coagulation, and in the mean time the watry with many ſaline Particles, are ſcattered into a tenuous and copious water. Yea it is a well known and vulgar obſervation, that Milk kept ſo long that it begins to grow ſower, if it be ſet over the fire, will be coagulated of it ſelf without any ſharp thing being put into it. Moreover on the contrary, if that Milk be impregnated with any Salt of divers condition from acid Salt, as to wit, fixed, nitrous, or volatile, being firſt diſſolved therein, it will not then be coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by any acid thing therein infuſed whilſt it boyls upon the fire: For I have often try'd this with the ſalt of Tartar and of Wormwood, with mineral Cryſtal, with Flowers of Salt Armoniack, Spirit of Harts-horn, and others of the ſame kind.

And indeed I have ſufficiently learned by often made experiments that theſe kind of mutations do conſtantly happen, <hi>viz.</hi> if Beer, Whitewine,<note place="margin">By what means the coagulation of Milk may be inhibited or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away.</note> Cyder, Vinegar, or any acid juice whatſoever, be dropped into Milk hot over the fire, preſently leaving the whole form of Milk it goes into a white thick mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and a diluted <hi>ſerum.</hi> Then if to all this yet warm, the ſalt of Tartar, Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, or any other deliquated vegetable whatſoever, or a ſolution of Salt Nitre, or Armoniack, yea the Flowers or Spirits of theſe, as alſo the ſpirits of Harts-horn, of Soot, and ſuch like be poured in, and the mixture be a little agitated, almoſt the whole Craſſament doth vaniſh quite away, only ſome ſmall portions, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain little coagulated bits remaining, which will ſwim diſperſed up and down tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the whole Liquor. Further yet on the contrary, if that fixed or nitrous Salt, or Flowers, or Spirits of Salt Armoniack, or alſo Spirits of Harts-horn, or of Soot, be caſt into boyling Milk, and then if you ſhould pour into the hot Liquor, Ale or Whitewine, Cyder or any other ſharp Liquor you pleaſe, no fuſion or coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation of the Milk ſhall follow thereupon. It will be worth our labour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider here from what cauſes each of theſe are made, and what analogy they bear with the fuſion, or inextricability or diſintanglement of the <hi>ſerum</hi> in the ſanguini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Maſs.</p>
                        <p>By the anatomy of Milk it plainly appears,<note place="margin">The reaſons of them are ſhewed.</note> that there is in it fewer ſpirituous Particles, very many watry, ſulphureous and terreſtrial indifferent, and in like manner ſaline, which are partly volatile and partly fixed: Therefore whilſt that the mixtion is kept whole, the ſaline Particles ſticking to the ſulphureous, divide them one from another, and alſo hinder them that they flee not away, or be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined with the Terreſtrial. In the mean time, the ſerous coming between the reſt ſo equally intermixt, fill up all the vacuities and make the Liquor as it were homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous; but then that there ſhould preſently follow a fuſion and coagulation of the Liquor upon ſome ſharp thing being poured to it, the reaſon is becauſe the fluid Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Salt in the acid thing, take hold of whatſoever others ſaline, to wit, both fixed and violatile, are in the Milk; to which whilſt they are ſtrictly united, the ſulphureous Particles ſliding from the embraces of the acid Salts do come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo being combined mutually among themſelves, and with the terreſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, they cauſe that thick ſubſtance ſeparating from the reſt of the Liquor: In the mean time, the watry Liquor having its pores almoſt emptied of its Sulphur and Earth, and almoſt only impregnated with the combinations of the Salts, by and by it becomes thin and diluted. That the thing is ſo, it plainly appears by the even now cited experiments, for as much as this coagulation of the Milk is hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred or taken away, by the caſting in of Salt either fixed, nitrous, or volatile; for every one of theſe Salts lays hold on the acid Salt of the infuſed Curd, and ſo prevents or breaks off its combinations with the ſaline Particles implanted in the Milk: But that the coagulation of the Milk being done away, it is not reſtored to its priſtine form; the reaſon is, becauſe the extraneous Particles of the adject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Salts remaining ſtill in the mixtion, do hinder the redintegration of the ſame mixture; but if they could be taken forth again, certainly the firſt mixture and lactiform would return again: Wherefore it may be thought of the Blood, that it being at any time depraved, although by fuſion or coagulation, becauſe it is wont to exterminate from it ſelf all the heterogeneus Particles, it may recover its due and priſtine mixtion.</p>
                        <p>But that Milk being long kept and growing ſower, ſhould coagulate upon the fire of its own accord without any acid thing being infuſed; the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in that Liquor then tending to putrefaction, the volatile ſaline Particles (as the manner is) being depreſſed into the <hi>fluor</hi> or ſtream, they become acid: Wherefore theſe, the pores of the Milk being opened in the boyling, ſnatch hold of their fellow ſaline-fixed Particles, to which whilſt they adhere, the ſulphureous ſlide away from them, and being mutually combined between themſelves, and with the terreſtrial, they make the white thick ſubſtance, the <hi>ſerum</hi> together with the combinations of the Salts, being fuſed or melted into an <hi>aquoſitie.</hi> Cold Milk neither of its own accord, nor by any ſharp thing being poured into it
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40331:48"/> is coagulated, becauſe, whilſt that the Pores are ſhut, the inteſtine Particles how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever diſpoſed ſo as they may be ready for new marriages or divorces, do not eaſily unlooſe themſelves, but the Paſſages being opened by the heat they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently enter into private Combinations, and Schiſms or Separations, as occaſion ſerves.</p>

For as much as this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is common both to the Fevour and the Scurvie in the former Diſeaſe, diureticks are chiefly proper, both the acid temperates of Vegetables, alſo of ſalt Nitre, of the Spirits of ſea Salt, of Vitriol <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Alſo ſuch as are indued with volatile Salt, as the ſpirits of Harts Horn, of ſalt Armoniack, ſalt of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, of Vipers and of others of that kind which we reherſed before in the Claſs of Diureticks.

In theſe caſes the Diureticks to be given ſhould be of that kind which does not ſcatter the Blood, but take away its Coagulations, as they are which are indued with fixed, volatile atd alchaliſate Salt, beſides ſuch as ſtrengthen or reſtore the ferment of the Reins as ſome ſulphureals and ſpirituals.

                        <p>FIrſt therefore, what belongs to the Saline Diureticks, ought to be referred hither, as we have often told you that Salts of whatſoever divers conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being commixed together, do mutually lay hold of one another, and by and by are joyned cloſe together; and while they are ſo combined, other Particles, being looſned from the mixture do ſeparate or fly away into Parts. This is planely perceived when the fluid or acid Salt is mixed together with the fixed or Alchaliſate,<note place="margin">The divers ſtates of Salts.</note> alſo when the fluid or fixed with the Volatile or ſharp. In truth all the buſineſs of all ſorts of ſolutions and precipitations depends upon this only affection of Salts. Wherefore as the Blood and the Humours of our Body, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds very much in Salt, and being wont to be variouſly changed by it from one State to another and for that cauſe a morbid Diſpoſition to accrue, and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over as divers ſorts of Saline Diurericks are full of fixed,<note place="margin">Their various affections.</note> fluid, nitrous, vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile or Alchaliſate Salt, there will be always need of great Diſcretion and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Phyſitian, that the Saline Particles in the Medicine may differ from thoſe in our Body. By what means this may be done, we ſhall declare by run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thorow every kind of Diuretick Salts.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Diureticks re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed with acid Salt.</note>Among the Diureticks imbued with acid Salt, the ſpirit of Salt or Nitre, alſo the Juice of Limons and Sorrel, white Wine, Rheniſh Wine and Cyder, are chiefly and commonly noted, and very often perform that intention: for theſe do only fuſe the Blood, and precipitate it into ſeroſities, even as ſharp things dropped into warm Milk. Notwithſtanding this does not happen to all alike, nor to every one indifferently. In a healthful conſtitution or not very far from it,<note place="margin">For whom Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient.</note> the Salt of the Blood is partly fixed and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Nitrous, and partly Volatile; alſo in ſome Scorbutical and Hydropical People it becomes for the moſt part fixed. Wherefore in all theſe caſes Diureticks indued with acid Salt are adminiſtred with ſucceſs: but in Catar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhous affections, and in ſome Hydropical and Scorbutical, when the Saline fixed Particles of the Blood are carried into the Form of a ſtream, and the Volatile are depreſſed (as it often happens) ſharp acetons Remedies do rather hurt than good; for as much as they do more pervert the Blood degenerated from its right Diſpoſition, but rather in theſe caſes, Medicines indued with a fixed or Volatile Salt, are of Uſe.</p>

                           <p>'Tis plane from the Figure, Colour, Taſt, and other properties, and accidents, that Nitre is a certain <hi>genus</hi> of Salt.<note place="margin">Diureticks in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with a ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Salt,</note> However it is divers from any other Salt or the condition of ſaline Particles, and is neither acid, nor fixed, or volatile, but a ſtate as it were in the middle between them. For ſo much it participates of volatile Salt, as whilſt it is made, it muſt be joyned to the lixivial and fixed ſalt with the Aſhes, that it might obtain a certain concretion, further when it is melted, by ſome Sulphur caſt in it, by and by it is inflamed and flies away: But it ſo much communicates with fixed Salt, as being melted in the Crucible, it ſuffers a continual fuſion, and perhaps perpetual, without any great loſs of Parts or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles. In truth Nitre is that whereby all the Plants do flouriſh, all living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures live and breath, and the flame or all ſublunary Fire is enkindled and ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as we have ſhewed more largely in another Tract, which it will not be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to repeat here.</p>
                           <p>But as to our preſent purpoſe, it is commonly enough known that the ſalt of Nitre doth refrigerate the Blood,<note place="margin">The reaſon of its effects.</note> and ſtrongly move Urine: but yet the Reaſon of either effect doth no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap> ſo clearly appear, becauſe Nitre is ſo far from contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cold carrying Particles in it ſelf, that on the contrary nothing can be more
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:40331:50"/> igniferous, as may be perceived in Gunpowder, and if it be diſtilled, flame, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than vapour or fume will ſeem to come into the Recipient: yea the diſtilled <hi>Stagma</hi> like actual Fire burns or corrodes all bodies whatſoever which are put to it. Neither is it leſs to be wondered at how this, whoſe nature is ſo fiery, ſhould ſo moiſten the Blood, and fuſe it into aquoſities, for the provoking eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation by Urine.</p>
                           <p>That I may propoſe our Conjectures concerning theſe things, I ſay that Nitre does help to produce theſe effects in a twofold reſpect; <hi>viz.</hi> for as much as it is a Salt ſomewhat a kin both to the fixed, and to the volatile, and for as much as it is a fire exciter: As to the firſt we have obſerved Nitre (even as alſo fixed and volatile Salts) being put into Milk, to hinder or take away its coagulation; in like manner alſo warm blood being poured to this as well as to thoſe is preſerved from coagulation and diſcolouration. Wherefore indeed the Particles of Nitre, being taken inwardly; keeps whole or reſtore the mixtion of the Blood; becauſe truly they will hinder or take away its fuſions and coagulations, from which heats and the <hi>Iſchuria</hi> or ſtoppage of the paſſage of the Urine, do very often ariſe.</p>
                           <p>But moreover Nitre, as much as it is fiery, being taken inwardly refrigerates the heated Blood and moves Urine: for that (as we have formerly hinted) enkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling more by its coming the flame of the Blood, before troubled, and intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with fumes, it renders it more clear and pure, and for that cauſe more gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; and ſo as the Blood, before troubled, whilſt that it burns more clearly by reaſon of the Nitre, is more laxed in its cloſe joynting; the ſerous Particles are more eaſily extricated from the more thick, and more plentifully go away.</p>

The reaſon of which is, becauſe the nitrous Salt having ſuffered a fluor or flux, is altogether altered from its firſt ſtate, and gets almoſt a like acetous diſpoſition, as other Salts ſuffering a Flux; yet an acid <hi>Stagma</hi> is drawn out of the Sulphur, which rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys the Fire, than that it ſhould be inflamed by it.</p>

But yet as familiar as it is, and though it be known as to its Type, its cauſes and formal reaſon notwithſtanding, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt altogether unknown. That I may be ſo bold to Philoſophize, or rather to conjecture concerning theſe; we will firſt of all give you a deſcription of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, as to all or the chief <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of it: Then we will endeavour diligently to find out from the fault, of what part or humour every of them ſingle do ariſe.</p>

Thoſe labouring with this Diſeaſe, piſs a great deal more than they drink, or take of any liquid aliment; and moreover they have always joyned with it continual thirſt, and a gentle, and as it were hectick Fever. But that as many Authors affirm the drink to be little or nothing changed, is very far from truth; becauſe the Urine in all (that I have known who hath hapned to have it, and I believe to be ſo in all) very much differing both from the drink taken in, and alſo from any humour that is wont to be begot in our Body, was wonderfully ſweet as it were imbued with Honey or Sugar. The occaſion of the foreſaid error (as I ſuppoſe) was the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:40331:53"/> colour of the Urine, which always appears crude, and watry as of thoſe labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with the <hi>Pica</hi> or with the Dropſie. That we may carefully ſearch out the reaſons of theſe Symptoms, we muſt firſt inquire from whence ſo quick and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious an excretion of Urine comes, and then we will proceed to the ſhewing of the remaining Reaſon of this Diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Its cauſe is not the attraction of the Reins.</note>It no way pleaſes us what ſome do aſſign for the cauſe of the <hi>Diabetes,</hi> the attracting force of the Reins: becauſe the Blood is not drawn to the Reins but driven thither by the motion of the Heart. Further neither doth the <hi>Serum</hi> ſeem to be drawn or emulged from the Blood waſhing thorow them, but to be ſeparated (as we have already more clearly ſhewed) partly by ſtraining, and partly by fuſion or a certain kind of precipitation: wherefore we believe the <hi>Diabetes</hi> to be rather and more immediately an affection of the Blood than of the Reins,<note place="margin">But rather a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquium</hi> of the Blood.</note> and to take from thence its origin, for as much as the maſs of Blood is as it were melted, and is too copiouſly fuſed into ſeroſity: which eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears truly from the quantity of the Urine increaſed into ſo great immenſity, which cannot proceed but from a melting and conſumption of the Blood. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo the remaining Blood, its <hi>Serum</hi> going away ſo plentifully, becomes more craſs or thick, and more apt to be coagulated, as may be argued from the ſwift working Pulſe: for the Heart is therefore more rapidouſly moved, that whilſt it exagitates the Blood more than uſual, it might preſerve it from Coagulation. Further that the fluidity of this, apt to be dangerous by reaſon of the too great loſs of the ſerous Liquor, might be continued, potulent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is moſt plentifully taken in an huge thirſt provoking to it, and beſides the Humours that are within the ſolid parts are ſupped up from the Blood, yea their fillings are melted for the reparation of this; hence it is that thoſe labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with this Diſeaſe are exceeding thirſty, and quickly grow lean.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">The Conjunct Cauſe is chiefly in the Blood.</note>Therefore, that I may endeavour to ſhew the conjunct cauſe and formal Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the <hi>Diabetes,</hi> I am led to believe the <hi>Craſis</hi> or mixtion of the Blood to be ſo laxed and as it were diſſolved that the watry Particles cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the more thick, bat that they quickly ſliding from their embraces, and being imbued with ſaline Particles, do run forth thorow the moſt open Paſſages of the Reins. But in the mean time other humours both from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out and from within for the moyſtning the Blood, and hindring it from coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, are conveyed into it; and the <hi>praecordia</hi> are urged even with a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty force into a more rapid motion.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Sometimes partly in the Reins.</note>But beſides we think the Reins ſometimes to be ſome part of the conjunct Cauſe, for that their ferment is wont ſometimes to be ſo vitiated, that it doth not preſerve the Blood by any influx of lixivial Salt, in due mixtion, and flui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, for the cauſe that the <hi>Serum</hi> might be ſeparated from it by percolation on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but ſometimes it happens from an acid Salt laid up in the Reins, that the Blood is precipitated whilſt it paſſes thorow them, as it were by a certain Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation or runnet into a copious ſeroſity, which is by and by ſent away by the Ureters. Hence it is to be obſerved that a plentiful and limpid Urine is made by moſt of thoſe obnoxious to the <hi>Nephritis</hi> or Gravel, in a violent pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſm or fit. The cauſe of which is, that the acid Humour, delated thither by the nervous Pipes, (as we have ſomewhere ſhewen) and exciting Pain, doth firſt fuſe the Blood ſliding into the Reins, and cauſes the going away of a more plentiful <hi>ſerum</hi> from it.</p>
                        <p>But it is not improbable but that a plentiful <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> or exceſſive evacuation by Urine, may in a ſort proceed from an evil conformation of the Reins, for as much as their lympathick little hollow <hi>Tubuli</hi> being too ample, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, they receive too readily the ſerous Liquor, and tranſmit it too ſwiftly without any <hi>Remora,</hi> ſo that therefore its greateſt quantity runs forth into U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine. But in truth as I may grant theſe little Tubes ſometimes and chiefly in thoſe troubled with the Stone or gravel, to be too open, yet for that cauſe there ſhould be rather purged forth a bloody then a copious Water. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we think a bloody Urine cheifly to proceed from ſome ſuch Cauſe. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over when a copious and bloody Urine comes together, we judge a dyſcraſie of the Blood to concur with an evil Conformation of the Reins, as ſhall be declared by and by in a notable caſe, of a certain ſick perſon.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time as it is not to be doubted that the cheif and moſt frequent
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:40331:53"/> cauſe of the <hi>Diabetes</hi> conſiſts in the Mixtion of Blood being too diſſolute and lax; ſo alſo by the like Reaſon, the ſmall <hi>Diureſis</hi> or leſſer than ought to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo very often depends upon the too ſtrict, and as it were cloſe joynting of the Blood.<note place="margin">As this diſeaſe often ariſes from the cloſe joynting of the Blood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too diſſolute,</note> Moreover we may opportunely inquire whether that the total ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Urine dos not ſometimes proceed from ſuch a cauſe? For though it is commonly enough known, that the cauſe of the <hi>Iſchuria</hi> or more ſtrong and pertinacious ſtopping of the urinal Paſſages, being moſt often placed below the Reins, depends altogether upon the urinarie pipes being wholly ſtopped, and when I my ſelf have opened many dead by the Urines being wholly ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, I found in all the invincible cauſe of Death to have been an obſtruction of the only Ureter a little before open (the other being long time ſhut up) by a Stone newly got in.<note place="margin">So the ſuppreſſion of the Urine ſometimes is from the too ſtrict joynting of the Blood.</note> Yet the moſt learned Doctor <hi>Riverius</hi> ſhews two caſes of ſick people in whom the <hi>Iſchuria</hi> or total ſuppreſſion of Urine, and that for many Days was cured by Phlebotomie only; and therefore he aſcribes the Cauſe of the Diſeaſe to the Emulging Veins being above meaſure diſtended, ſo that they could not contract themſelves for the expulſion of the <hi>Serum,</hi> even as it may be obſerved every where in the urinal Bladder, which being very full, is not eaſily compoſed to the making of Water. But indeed as we give belief (as 'tis likely) to theſe Hiſtories, yet we ought not to aſſent to the Aetiology. Becauſe that is not the office of the Emulging Veins, which that famous man hath aſſigned them, for not the Veins, but the Arteries conſtantly convey the <hi>Serum</hi> together with the Blood, without any danger of hardneſs or plenitude of Urine; but as the <hi>Serum</hi> does not quickly run forth into the open Paſſages, the reaſon ſeems to be, that the Maſs of the Blood being too ſtrict, and compacted hardly lets go out of its Boſome the watry liquor intimately mixed with it.</p>
                        <p>Hither may be referred the Anatomical Obſervation lately made on the dead Body of the Reverend Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter</hi> when as that moſt illuſtrious Lord,<note place="margin">This is confirm'd by anatomical Obſervations,</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a long while troubled with the Stone, at laſt by a continual ſuppreſſion of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine had yeilded to Death, preſently all did preſume, the cauſe of Death to have been the Ureters being wholy ſtopped up by a Stone or gravelly matter, but by a diſquiſition made through a moſt accurate Anatomie, not any obſtruction at all in thoſe Pipes, or impediment of the Urine could be found. The like anatomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal obſervation was related to me by that moſt learned man, Doctor <hi>Lower</hi> not long before made by himſelf, where the <hi>Iſchuria</hi> being deadly had not left any ſigns of it about the urinary Veſſels: Hence it is eaſy to divine, for beſides the reins were whole and ſound, that the cauſe of this diſeaſe was altogether in the too great Concretion and Compaction of the Blood.</p>
                        <p>But to return from this diverſion after having unfolded the conjunct cauſe,<note place="margin">The procatartick Cauſes of the <hi>Diabetes.</hi>
                           </note> and the Reaſon of the <hi>Diabetes,</hi> we will proceed to the ſearching out its procatarctick or more remote cauſes. Therefore if it be inquired into, from whence the joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or compaction of the Blood becomes ſo looſe and lax, and apt to melt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſeroſities; we ſay of this even as of Milk, that its fuſion proceeds frum this, for that as in its Maſs Salts of a divers nature do agree, or are aſſociated, the other particles (which ſeparated themſelves from them of courſe, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined in the mixtion) being freed from the Saline, preſently go away into Parts. If that it ſhall be further inquired into, from whence thoſe Salts come, by whoſe private combination we ſuppoſe the mixtion of the Blood to be looſed,<note place="margin">They are firſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid humors hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening to the Blood, and fuſing or precipitating it after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Milk.</note> and its fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion introduced; we need no long ſearch for them: for it planely appears, that there is naturally in the bloody Maſs, fixed and volatile ſaline Particles, to which if at any time an acid Salt doth plentifully come, or obtains a flux, it will eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excite the aforeſaid Affection. Hence it is that Rheniſh Wine, Cyder, and acid Liquors being drunk provoke a more plentiful <hi>Diureſis</hi> or Evacuation by Urine; therefore alſo in ſome ſickly People whoſe Blood abounds in an acid Salt, Medicines indued with a fixed or volatile Salt are wont to move the Urine. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth this Affection ſtill happen only from things taken, but from the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours produced within. It is obſerved that many obnoxious to Convulſive af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, before or after the paroxyſms do make a great plenty of limpid, or clear watry Urine, the cauſe of which certainly is, for that the recrements or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities of the Blood and nervous Juice being heaped up in the ſolid parts, whenſoever they being degenerated into a ſowerneſs, ſhall ſwell up and flow back again upon the Blood, they induce its fuſion, and for that reaſon a flux of Urine.
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:40331:54"/> Wherefore when there is ſuch a conſtant, and habitual profuſion of Urine, nothing can be more likely ſaid than that the excrementitious humours being ſent away into the ſolid parts, and from thence after they had there contracted a ſower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs being returned into the Blood, they fuſe or melt its Liquor into too much ſeroſity, and for that reaſon provoke ſo continual, and immenſe excretion.</p>

                           <note place="margin">How the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betes</hi> and the Dropſy differ.</note>The <hi>Diabetes</hi> is commonly called the Chamber-pot Dropſy, and ſome affirm either the Diſeaſe to be indeed the ſame, and to have the ſame cauſes, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Reaſon, and the ſymptoms only to be varied as to the manner of the ſerous excretion; to wit, that the Blood in either being alike affected not able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the <hi>Serum,</hi> and being conſtrained to ſpue it forth from the Arteries, in the one pours it forth into the habit it ſelf of the Body, and Cavities of the <hi>Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cera,</hi> and in the other, puts it aſide in the Reins abundantly to be carried away by the Ureters. But truly if the buſineſs be more narrowly conſidered, there will be found a notable difference between theſe two Diſeaſes. For the <hi>Anaſarca</hi> takes its original for the moſt part firſtly from hence, becauſe the Blood being imbecill, and too frigid is not enough enkindled, and heated, that it might continually concoct the Chyle that is carried to it, and aſſimilate it, and ſo volatilize it, as thereby it might be conteined in its boſome in the Circulation; but there is a neceſſity to ſpue this forth in all places together with the ſerous juice, and to leave it neer the <hi>Interſtitia</hi> of the Veſſels: then afterwards the Diſeaſe growing grievous the blood is not only made weak by Crudities, but becoming degenerate in its complexion is obnoxious to fluxions, and to Coagulations, and for that cauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets ſerous humours more plentifully, and pours them forth upon the undue parts, more impetuouſly. But on the contrary in the <hi>Diabetes</hi> the Blood is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, yea to the utmoſt hot, and too much enkindled and concocts ſwiftly, and beyond meaſure the Chyle is carried to it: yea it melts the ſolid Parts, and ſups up their meltings, carries them about with it thorow the Veſſels, and boyls or cooks it more then enough; but when as by reaſon of the meeting of Salts the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pages</hi> or conſiſtence of the Blood is thorowly diſſolved, and fuſed into ſeroſities, portions being ſeparated within the reins, whatſoever are able to break away, run forth by the Ureters. If any Diſeaſe like, but inverſe to the <hi>Diabetes</hi> (to wit, in which the Blood being diſſolved into ſeroſities, did pour forth its liquids thorow the whole Body) did ever happen, without doubt it was ſometime the epidemical Fevour called the Engliſh Sweat, where the Blood melting into aquo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities did pour forth all the humours both profitable and unprofitable, even to the expence of the vital food, into the pores of the Body to be ſent away by Sweat.</p>

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:40331:54"/> Beer, or ſharp Wines; ſometimes ſadneſs, long grief, alſo convulſive affections, and other inordinations and depreſſions of the animal ſpirits are wont to beget and cheriſh this morbid Diſpoſition.

I remember two Women obnoxious to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive and hypochondriack Affections, to whom accrued from thence a great flood of Urine with languor, and waſting away of the Fleſh.</p>

                           </note> there remains yet for us to ſhew the reaſons of the known ſymptoms, I ſuppoſe ſome of them to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt enough out of the premiſes, to wit, wherefore there is ſo ſwift and copious an excretion of urine in the <hi>Diabetes:</hi> But that the ſick are fevouriſh, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thirſty, the reaſon is partly,<note place="margin">From whence the often and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious piſſing.</note> becauſe the humours and the juices by which both the Blood and the ſolid parts are moyſtned and refreſhed, are by a too continual expenſe drawn forth by the <hi>Diureſis,</hi> or urinary evacuation,<note place="margin">From whence the Fevour with thirſt and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing.</note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the throat is dry, and the <hi>Praecordia</hi> are greatly heated: and partly becauſe the Heart by the urgent inſtinct of Nature, and the Lungs are provoked into a more rapid motion, that the Blood being deprived of the moyſtning <hi>Serum,</hi> might be hindred from coagulation or concretion or growing together, and might be continued in its due Circulation.</p>
                        <p>But it ſeems more hard to unfold,<note place="margin">Wehrefore the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine of the ſick is ſweet lik ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</note> wherefore the Urine of the ſick is ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully ſweet, or hath an honied taſte; when rather on the contrary if accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> the fuſion of the Blood and (which therefore follows) the profuſion of the Urine happens by reaſon of the combinations of Salts, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor certainly impregnated with theſe ſhould be rather ſalt then ſweet. But it is eaſy to unfold this in declaring firſt of all that the urine is deprived of its ſalt taſte, for as much as many Salts that are of divers Nature are combined in it. For this appears by a manifold experiment in Chymiſtry, that if Salts that are of a divers Nature, as fixed and volatile, be mixed with an acid thing, the acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of either is diminiſhed or loſt; wherefore we need not wonder that the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine of thoſe labouring with the <hi>Diabetes</hi> is not ſalt. But why that it is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully ſweet like Sugar or hony, this difficulty is worthy of explanation.<note place="margin">The honied taſte is not from the nutritious juice, but from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations of Salts with Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Some would think this effect to ariſe from this, that together with the Blood running forth thorow the Reins, both the recent nutritious Liquor, and the meltings of the ſolid parts are ſent away, wherefore it ſhould ſeem not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that this ſweetneſs ſhould be procured from theſe fat juices being mixed with Stale. But indeed from that mixture only a ſoft taſte like milk or broth of fleſh, pleaſingly ſoft, but not ſweet like hony ſhould ariſe, yea but to this which is not only grateful but in a manner pricking, Saline ſpiculas or little ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings together with ſulphureous ſweetnings (as I have elſe where ſhewed) ought to concur. Wherefore as we have ſhewed Sugar and Hony to be made ſweet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly by the concretions of ſaline Sulphurs, ſo it may be ſuſpected of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine in the <hi>Diabetes,</hi> that with the ſalts combined in the <hi>Serum</hi> ſulphureous Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles picked forth of the Colliquation of the ſolid parts, do grow together.</p>
                        <p>As to the fore-knowledge, this Diſeaſe at firſt is often eaſily cured,<note place="margin">Prognoſticks of the Diſeaſe.</note> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confirmed moſt rarely or with difficulty. For as much as the diſpoſition of the Blood being but a little laxed, is reduced without great trouble, but that being very much looſed ſo that very many parts ſeparate the one from the other, it ſcarce or never can be reſtored.</p>
                        <p>As to what belongs to the Cure, it ſeems a moſt hard thing in this Diſeaſe to draw true propoſitions of curing, for that its cauſe lies ſo deeply hid, and hath its origine ſo deep and remote. For, what is commonly thought, that the Reins, and the other ſolid parts, containing or tranſmitting the <hi>Serum</hi> and the Blood are in the fault, becauſe that they ſend away too haſtily their contents, and for that cauſe of aſtringing Medicines are chiefly and altogether to be inſiſted on: I ſay both reaſon and experience doth contradict both this <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> and practice, for that few or none are cured by this Method: and it is highly improbable (if I may not ſay impoſſible) for that <hi>Diureſis</hi> to proceed from ſuch a cauſe.<note place="margin">Three I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore the chief Intentions of healing as to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal Cure of this Diſeaſe are to take care there be no fuſion of the Blood,<note place="margin">The chief Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of healing.</note> and if any be made to take it away. In the Firſt place the fuſion of the Blood is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited whilſt that its more craſs parts,<note place="margin">To hinder the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Blood.</note> and watry do continue themſelves, and are contained together, neither the one go away from the other ſo continually and very haſtily; which indeed is effected by thickning Remedies commonly ſo called; whoſe viſcous and very glutinous bodies being admitted into the bloody Maſs do pertinaciouſly ſtick cloſe to its active Particles, and ſo ſeparate them one from another, and hinder them, leſt they ſhould be mutually combined among themſelves by an ariſen flood or with ſuffuſed ſaline Particles from another place. For this end Rice, white Starch, alſo Gums, and ſome Reſins are wont to be help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in this Diſeaſe.<note place="margin">
                              <hi>2.</hi> To take it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way being made.</note> In the ſecond place, that the fuſion of the Blood being alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy made, may be taken away, thoſe ſorts of Remedies have been made known which diſſolve the concretions of the Salts, ſo that all the implanted elementary Particles, being at laſt made of their own kind, may recover their former State, and ſo make whole again the ancient complexion or <hi>Craſis</hi> of the Blood. Of this ſort are ſuch as have an effect on coagulated Milk, fixed, volatile, and nitrous Salts, alſo ſpirits of Harts horn, of <hi>Sal</hi> Armoniack and ſuch like, as we have ſhew'd before.<note place="margin">Which is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be effected by Salines of a divers Nature.</note> The reaſon of which is (as we have in the ſame place intimated) that whilſt the ſaline, fixed, volatile or nitrous Particles, being in a ſufficient quantity put into the Milk, do meet with the acid or precipitatory Particles, and are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined with them, the remaining ſaline Particles which are bound, being now freed and diffuſed thorow the Maſs of the Liquor do diſſociate the ſulphureous terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrial combined among themſelves, and diſperſe them on every ſide, becauſe that all the Particles being equally mixed again, they might mutually contain themſelves, and be contained. So alſo by theſe the anology of the Blood is altered by reaſon of the ſaline Stagmas powred thereto being warm, we have there ſhewn by received experiments. But yet for curing the <hi>Diabetes,</hi> becauſe that ſaline Medicaments are for the moſt part eſteemed to be always Diuretick, we muſt not eaſily or raſhly give them, although in the mean time, as neither reaſon ſo neither experience is contrary to this Method. For I have often preſcribed in this Diſeaſe the tincture of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony with good ſucceſs, alſo a water of a ſolution of quick Lime with ſhavings of Saſſaphras, Anis ſeeds, Raiſins and Liquoriſh, according to the vulgar Receipt, is very much commended by ſome.</p>

                        <p>But yet the diſpoſition to this Diſeaſe did not ſo thorowly ceaſe,<note place="margin">A Relapſe of the ſame diſeaſe.</note> but that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards being apt to relapſe by frequent fits, by reaſon of any diſorders of living, and perhaps by reaſon of changes about the times of the year; he at firſt made his Water more plentifully, and then limpid and ſweet, with a feveriſh thirſt and languiſhing of Spirits: But by the uſe of the ſame Medicines it was wont to go away again in a ſhort time.

That theſe may be the better known, it is behooful in the firſt place to declare what the matter of Sweat is, and its formal reaſon, and in what, and by how many ways plentiful ſweating very often happens without evacuation, by reaſon of external accidents, or by an inteſtine Orgaſm of humors or ſpirits.</p>
                        <p>In the <hi>Diaphoreſis</hi> or evacuation by Sweat contrary to Purging, the motion of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion tends from the firſt paſſages,<note place="margin">How Evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Sweat dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from Purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> and as it were from the moſt inward Center of the Body to the Circumference: In both theſe the Arteries do carry more to the places of Evacuation, than the Veins do carry back; at other times the Veins do render back from the places which are oppoſite to them, more than the Arteries do force away. In purging, a greater load is impoſed to be carried by the ſplanchnical Arteries, together with the Veins reſpecting the habit of the body: But it is quite contrary in evacuation by Sweat, becauſe in this whilſt the Arteries do convey more than ordinary towards the circuit of the Body, the Meſaraick Veins do carry away a greater proviſion from the <hi>Viſcera</hi> of concoction, than the Arteries do bring thither.

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:40331:59"/> rapidouſly. But of ſuch an efferveſcency or enkindling there are too many cauſes, and pretexts. For ſometimes the Blood being too much carried forth by its proper Sulphur, after the manner of Vines, ſwells up of its own accord. Further that, from hot things taken in at the mouth, by reaſon of an ambient or outward heat, a more quick motion of the Body, the ſhutting up of the Pores, and many occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions being heated or agitated above meaſure, and more than uſually inkindled, requires to be ſo circumagitated or turned about, for that ſweating might fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>

For indeed in acute griefs, violent paſſions, in great impediments of the natural and vital functions, in the Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it ſelf of Death, and in other faintings or affections of the Spirits, when the health of the body is greatly in danger, the ſenſitive Soul, that it might conſerve the vital flame of the Blood from expiring, inſtigates the Heart into a moſt rapid motion, whereby, whilſt the Blood is driven about more impetuouſly, for the moſt part alſo ſweat is ſtirred up.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond thing requiſite for the ſtirring up of ſweat is,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Of the</hi> Ephi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droſis.</note> that whilſt the Blood growes exceeding hot, or is inflamed more than its wont, and emits plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful <hi>Effluvias,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">The ſecond Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is that the joyntings of the blood be lax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and looſned.</note> its <hi>Latex</hi> or water in the ſerous humour which is apt to go away and to be exhaled from its remaining Maſs, abundantly overflowes; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a dry evaporation alone as from boyled oyl, alſo urged by a fevouriſh or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other intenſe heat breaks forth, and no ſweat.

                        <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>3.</hi> The third Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that the Pores be open e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</note> it is required for the right procuring of ſweating that whilſt the Blood grows hot, and is ſufficiently moiſtned by a watry and eaſily ſeparable hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, the Pores alſo of the skin ſhould be unlocked and lye open; for unleſs the Body be perſpirable, it will be in vain to endeavour a <hi>Diaphoreſis</hi> or ſweating. Some have ſo very thick skins and almoſt not to be pierced thorow, that if helpt too by winter cold, thou mayeſt oftentimes wring out water ſooner from a Pumice Stone than out of their hides.</p>
                        <p>So much for the chief things neceſſary for the ſtirring up of the <hi>Ephidroſis</hi> or ſweating, which for that ſometimes they may be in ſome part defective,<note place="margin">The cauſes of too much ſweating are hinted.</note> may be the cauſe that ſweat hardly or not at all ſucceeds, ſo ſometimes by reaſon of the exceſs of theſe, or ſome other irregularities about the humours or habit of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, too often and too plentiful ſweating is wont to infeſt ſome; ſo much that the nutritious Juice is no ſooner conveyed to the Blood, but the whole preſently; with the ſerous water ſweating out at the Pores of the skin, is ſpent in moiſture. If we ſhall inquire into the Reaſons of this, theſe three do chiefly occur, in ſome of which or in all together they ſeem to conſiſt.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. A too great propenſion therefore to ſweating ariſes,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>1.</hi> The firſt of which is Dyſcra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy or debility or a more ſparing inkindling of the Blood.</note> becauſe the Blood is vitiated in its <hi>Craſis,</hi> and being made weaker doth not aſſimilate the nutritious Juice which it receives from the Chyle; wherefore, as a Stomach of a broken and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound tone, it is compelled to vomit forth the infuſed humour, as ſoon as it is fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with it. Hence it is that nocturnal ſweatings and very grievous do ſo very much follow in continual Fevours; for as much as in theſe the Maſs of the blood (like ſower milk, which being made hot over the fire, is fuſed of its own accord with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the addition, of any coagulating thing, and precipitated into ſeroſity) is of ſo looſe joynting, that it is upon every light occaſion looſned in the mixtion. To which it may happen that the blood being impoveriſhed is not fully inkindled, wherefore there is a neceſſity for it that the crude juices, that are but little waſted by efflagration, ſhould whilſt the blood is incited break forth more plentifully into ſweat.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, It is not improbable that the too great propenſion to ſweat does in ſome meaſure proceed from this cauſe,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>2.</hi> The Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> by other wonted ways be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prohibited,</note> 
                           <hi>viz.</hi> that either the Reins or the Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaeducts do not every where ſufficiently perform their offices. For if by chance the ſuperfluous ſeroſities of the arterious blood are not ſent away by this or that
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:40331:60"/> way, there will be a neceſſity that they muſt be ſomewhere ſtored up, hinder the circulation of the blood, and not ſeldom cauſe the Dropſy.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, If at any time for the aforeſaid Reaſons the ſweating diſpoſition ſhall affect one,<note place="margin">The third the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneſs of the Pores.</note> the ſame may be further increaſed, and more often and more copious ſweats may diſtill forth of the Pores of the skin, and paſſages ſhall be more open than ordinary; which kind of affection is ſometimes from nature, and ſometimes from ſome accident. I have known the Bodies of ſome to be ſo cribroſe or full of holes that they were not able to ſuffer the leaſt breath of air, who alſo by every more quick motion, or by the heat of the Sun, the fire, or of the Bed, would be forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with diſſolved into moiſture.</p>

                        <p>So much for the Nature of Sweat, and of both the conjunct and manifeſt cauſes.<note place="margin">The differences of Sweat.</note> As to what be ongs to its differences, it is wont to be diſtinguiſhed many ways, to wit, that itl was ſpontaneous or forced, or partial or univerſal, or critick or ſymptomatick, the reaſons of all which are clearly enough made known by what hath been already ſaid. Moreover ſweat is either hot, of which we have diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed hitherto, or cold in the Act, which ſort is frequently excited by a panick fear,<note place="margin">The cauſes of cold Sweat.</note> a very acute grief, ſwooning, and in every ſudden failing of the Spirits, and the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gony of Death. The cauſe of this ſeems to be, that from a huge and ſudden paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the whole ſoul ſinking down contract its compaſs, and therefore the Spirits being ſcatter'd, and the Blood with the heat being drawn back towards the Heart, the outmoſt <hi>Effluvias</hi> paſſing forth thorow the skin being left by the following, and deſtitute of Heat, therefore they are condenſed into a cold Vapour, even as by the like Reaſon it is wont to happen in diſtilling. For if you ſuddenly repreſs or extinguiſh the fire, preſently the warm exhalation filling the Alembick is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved into a dew.</p>
                        <p>From theſe things thus premiſed and ſhown,<note place="margin">Of what ſort Diaphoretick Medicines ought to be.</note> which are chiefly requiſite to the provoking of Sweat, and by which occaſions chiefly, and ordinary accidents it is wont to be ſtirred up, it will not be difficult to ſhew with what powers and Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles Diaphoretick Medicines ought to be enricht, and by what means they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce their effects And firſt of all, as to what belong to their Properties or Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. Hydroticks or ſweating Medicines that are to be taken inwardly ought to be of that kind which may make the blood to be more hot than ordinary, and by conſequence to evaporate; alſo which may after a ſort unlock and fuſe its Maſs oftentimes too much compacted, and thickned, that from thence its ſeroſities may more eaſily be ſeparated and go away, and at the ſame time diſpoſe them ſo ſeparated, rather to be caſt forth by a <hi>Diaphoreſis</hi> or ſweating than by Urine or Siege.

As to the firſt concerning Diaphoretick Medicines in general, we note them to be ſuch whoſe Particles are friendly enough to the Ventricle and Inteſtines, and do not provoke to any convulſion or excretory motion; moreover that they are in no wiſe to be overcome by them or to be aſſimilated like to Aliments; but that being taken into the Stomach they forthwith diſpoſe both the animal Spirits, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Blood to yeild to an <hi>Ephidroſis</hi> or ſweating. But indeed ſome of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing immerſed in the Ventricle, and diſſolved, by and by they ſtir up, and recreate the animal Spirits every where abounding in the nervous Fibres (of which the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Coat is made) for the end that the <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> of the whole ſenſitive Soul being preſently erected, and ſtretched forth into a greater compaſs, they might make the <hi>Praecordia</hi> to be more lively actuated, and ſo the blood being rarefied and more inkindled, to be carried about more rapidouſly, and ſo to be driven into a <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoreſis</hi> or ſweating. Further, in the mean time the Particles of the ſame Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine do pour themſelves into the blood which waters the ſtomachal Veſſels (which moſt thickly cover the nervous Coat) and whilſt that they by and by ferment it, and make it to grow hot, they compel it to be forced thorow the veins more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidly than it is wont towards the <hi>Praecordia;</hi> to which when it is more impetuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought, preſently the Pulſe of the heart being increaſed the whole Maſs of blood rarefied, and more inkindled, and by the Particles of the Medicine moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately mixed with it, agitated, it is carried along more quick thorow the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries to all the exterior parts; where when all its water is not able to be carried back, or received by the Veins or other leading Pipes, there is a very great neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity for much of the ſerous humour to be reſolved into Sweat. But the Particles of the ſweating Medicine, being admitted according to the aforeſaid manner into the Blood, do not only ferment and agitate its Liquor, but oftentimes they ſo looſen, and unlock its miſtion, that its <hi>Serum</hi> and other excrements may be more eaſily ſeparated and ſent away. But for as much as this may happen to be done by a divers means according both to the divers conſtitution of the blood, and the Nature or preparation of the Medicine; it will here be worth our while briefly to explicate the chief Indications about moving a <hi>Diaphoreſis</hi> or ſweating, and the various ways of proſecuting it, together with the Reaſons of them. But it is further to be noted in the firſt place that Hydrotick or ſweating Medicines as to their ways of working and operations,<note place="margin">Sweating Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines are neer a kin to moſt Cardiacks or Cordials.</note> have a great affinity with moſt Cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als commonly ſo called, in ſo much that many things of either kind are of common uſe or reciprocal, and as they ſo differ chiefly as to their greater or leſſer efficacy, as often as it is behoveful to paſs from one kind to another, there is need almoſt only to augment or diminiſh the Doſe, and chiefly to chooſe fit times for admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP III.</hi> Of too great or depraved <hi>Diaphoreſis</hi> or Sweating, and its Remedy.</head>
                        <p>As our Life is in a continual flux, therefore as new things ought to be added and put to it, ſo old and out-worn things ought continually to be drawn and carried away from it: Wherefore that all ſuperfluous and incongruous Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles whatſoever, may be perpetually moved away; there are manifold ways of departings and excretions; in the doing of which, however Nature oftentimes knows not a meaſure, and goes either on this ſide or beyond, that which is moſt commodious. How it behoveth us to correct or moderate thoſe Evacuations, which leading inward from the circumference or exterior compaſs of the Body, do purge forth by a certain particular Sink, as often as they offend in exceſs or in defect, we have ſhewed above: The way of our method requires now, that we alſo ſhew a Remedy, if that at any time the <hi>Diaphoreſis</hi> or evacuation by ſweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, (which tending from the Centre towards the Circumference, is the chief ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and diffuſive Excretion) ſhould be too much or depraved.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Exceſſive ſweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is a frequent Affection.</note>And indeed that this ſort of affection doth too often happen, is obvious enough to common obſervation; for that there is nothing more uſual, than that thoſe labouring with the Phthiſick or Scurvy, and others that are hardly recovered out of long Fevers, yea ſome without any diſeaſe or evident <hi>prophaſis,</hi> live obnoxious to aſſiduous, and oftentimes very great Sweats. Therefore concerning the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phidroſis</hi> exceſſive, we will enquire firſt how many ways, and from what cauſes ſuch an Evacuation may ariſe: Then we will ſhew what Remedies, and what kind
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:40331:66"/> of a manner of Adminiſtrations are moſt convenient in every caſe of it.</p>
                        <p>As to the firſt of theſe; often and immoderate Sweating is ſometimes a Symptom of ſome other preſent Diſeaſe; for this is familiar (as we ſaid but now) in the Phthiſick and Scurvie: the reaſon of which is this, to wit,<note place="margin">Sometimes it is a ſymptome of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Diſeaſe.</note> that when the Blood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing corrupted either by ſome impure Miaſm, or having got an evil diſpoſition, doth not rightly concoct and aſſimilate the nouriſhing Juice continually ſuffuſed into its Maſs, it ſifts out and caſts forth adoors by Sweat that do far degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, heaped up to a fulneſs together with other excrements.</p>
                        <p>The Cure of this Sudation depends wholly on the healing of the Diſeaſe whoſe Symptom it is; in the mean time concerning this as much as belongs to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Living, a profitable and neceſſary Indication is taken from that Symptom, to wit, that when nightly and copious Sweats happen in thoſe Diſeaſes, a Diet ſhould be preſcribed altogether of light aliments, <hi>viz.</hi> milk Grewel, Barly Cream and ſuch like, whoſe light and ſoft Particles the bloody Maſs may bear, and not of Fleſh, or ſtronger Meats.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. An exceſſive <hi>Ephidroſis</hi> is ſometimes an effect of another paſt and gon Diſeaſe,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>2.</hi> When alſo it is an Effect.</note> as when it ſucceeds long Fevours: for ſo it ſtill happens that fevouriſh burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings do terminate in hydrotick Dews (as an hot Summer ends in a rainy Autumn) that ſcarce any one can recover from a long Diſeaſe with this indiſpoſition remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; which notwithſtanding is moderate and eaſily to be cured in ſome, but in others more grievous, and not leſs infeſtous than the Diſeaſe whoſe offſpring it was. I knew a young Man, who growing well after a quartan Ague of ten Months,<note place="margin">A notable exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of exceſſive Sweating.</note> when he began to want his Fitts, he daily melted into ſo profuſe Sweats, that he was neceſſitated to change his Shirt and Sheets all wetted (as if they were dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in Water) thrice every Night. By reaſon of this Evacuation continuing ſo for many Weeks, his Fleſh ſo fell away, and his ſtrength was ſo exhauſted, that he was almoſt reduced to the dryneſs of a Skeleton. He, when he had uſed a long time various Remedies without any benefit, at length by the drinking Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Morning of Aſſes Milk, and his other diet being ordered of Cowes Milk, grew well in a ſhort time.</p>
                        <p>In ſuch like Caſes the Blood perpetually caſting back its contents,<note place="margin">The reaſon of it.</note> and as it were vomiting them forth by the mouths of the Arteries, preſently caſt forth a doors not only the Chyle ſuffuſed from the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> but moreover ſupping up again for its Food both the nervous Juice, and the Farciments or fillings up of the ſolid parts, by and by loathing all thoſe together, with the nutritious Liquor, expells them by the Pores of the Skin.</p>
                        <p>The chief Cauſe of this Diſeaſe ſeems to conſiſt in the dyſcraſie and debilitie of the Blood;<note place="margin">The cauſe of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Sweating.</note> for as much as its Liquor like ſower Milk is apt to be continually fuſed, and precipitated into ſeroſities; wherefore both its proper meltings, and alſo the humours which are poured in from any other place that cannot indeed be aſſimilated, are forthwith ſeparated,<note place="margin">Partly from the vitiated <hi>Craſis</hi> of the Blood.</note> and when the Pores of the Skin are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry open, are ſent forth adoors by <hi>Diaphoreſis</hi> or ſweating rather than by any other way of excretion. But that the Blood is diſpoſed ſo into fuſions or fluxes, for the moſt part the cauſe is the Dominion of the fluid or acid Salts (even as in ſower Milk) in its Maſs. But ſometimes the nervous Juice degenerated into a ſowerneſs is firſt and rather the fault, for by that reaſon its Acid Excrements being chewed over again in the Blood, do fuſe its Maſs, and precipitate it into ſeroſities: further from ſuch a cauſe we do Judge the <hi>Diabetes</hi> and the Engliſh Sweat ſo called (becauſe it was here general) to have had their origin.</p>
                        <p>This kind of exceſſive <hi>Ephidroſis</hi> is not wont only to ariſe from the vitiated <hi>Craſis</hi> and fermentation of the Blood,<note place="margin">Partly from its lack of Heat.</note> but ſometimes by reaſon of its depraved Enkindling. It hath been already ſhewn by what means the Blood breaks forth into Sweat feavouriſhly growing hot by reaſon of the exceſs of Sulphur. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over this Symptom ſometimes follows no leſs by reaſon of the Defect of Sulphur: for when that the Blood being impoveriſhed, and made more watrie is leſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindled, therefore as often as it is urged into a more rapid motion by an acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red heat, or agitation of the Body, there will be a neceſſity that its ſeroſities (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot be conſumed by heat, or inſenſibly exhaled) ſhould be reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into Sweat. Sulphur is wanting in the Blood either becauſe it is conſumed, as after long Feavours, or becauſe it is not enough generated by reaſon of lack of Suſtenance. We may obſerve this latter not only in many men who being ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:40331:69"/> having the right ſtrength of their Members, they ſeem found or well, yet they were not able to bear naked the leaſt Blaſt of Wind or Air, but preſently there followed a great Perturbation of Spirits with a failing of all the Faculties and an indiſpoſition of the whole Body;<note place="margin">Its Deſcription.</note> which kind of Irregularity ſo lightly Contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they cannot either quickly or eaſily ſhake off, but hardly, and not but after a long time recover their former healthful Condition: Thoſe proclive to this Dyſpathy or Infirmity fear the Air more then others do Fire or Water. Hence ſome dare not go forth adoors, others living within a cloſe Chamber ſuffer nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Door or Caſement to be opened, and if by chance a little Breath of Air get in by ſome hidden chink, they preſently feel it, and are hurt by it. I have known ſome from ſuch a cauſe fixed for many Months in their Bed. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber a Footman healthful and ſtrong enough, who for above ten Years never went out of his Chamber, nor could be perſwaded to it, nor hired at any rate to go forth: and when afterwards the Houſe being on fire he was drawn out by force, he was very dangerouſly caſt down by it for very many Months without any other hurt: others are affraid to ſtand or walk upon an Earthen Floor or Brick or Stone Pavement, for that they are wont thereby to contract great hurt very many other the like caſes every where happen, to whom further this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felicity is added, that few commiſerate thoſe that are ſo affected, neither are they believed to be ſick indeed but only in Imagination.</p>
                        <p>That we may a little therefore ſearch into the nature of this Affection,<note place="margin">The reaſon is ſearched into.</note> we think that it is not for nothing that they complain, but without doubt they feel a certain pain or trouble in themſelves inflicted by the received Cold, or by the altered manner of tranſpiration, but that it may appear what it is, and in what the reaſon of it conſiſts, it behoveth us in the firſt place to conſider, by what ordinary means the Particles of the ambient Air get into the Pores of our Skin, and affect the ſubjects of them, to wit, the Animal Spirits diffuſed every where over the Superficies of the Body. For indeed as they are of a certain etherial diſpoſition or Nature, theſe appear to be greatly refreſhed, and to be ſtirred up into as it were a flattering Expanſion by the neer of kin particles both of the Air and Light, whilſt thoſe come proportionate to them: and in like manner the Blood, whilſt that it paſſes thorow in its Circuit, the exterior Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Body,<note place="margin">By what means both the Blood and Spirits are affected by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſing Air.</note> exhales even there as in the <hi>Praecordia</hi> by the Mouths of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries its Miſts or Smokes, and receives by the gapings of the Veins the ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous Food for the ſuſtaining its Flame. For theſe benefits both of the Blood and of the animal Spirits, the Pores of the Skin are conveniently made and ought to ly open in that manner, that the Particles of the Air and Light in a moderate plenty being ſomewhat refracted, and with a gentle ſliding to, might ſtrike the outmoſt Borders of the ſubſtance of either of them. For otherwiſe if there ſhould be an improportionate approach of the agent to this or that patient or to both together, preſently perturbations ariſe in this, or that, or together in either part of the Soul. For if the out-dwelling Spirits are either weak, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm of themſelves and quickly diſſipable, or by reaſon of the Pores of the Skin lying too much open are expoſed to the more ſharp and naked air, it ſtill comes to paſs that they are forced upon every light occaſion into flights and diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and for that cauſe Griefs, Convulſions or reſolutions or unbindings are ſtirred up here and there, not only about the exterior parts of the Body; but ſometimes, from taking Cold (as they uſe to ſay) a falling down of the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy (which is not quickly or eaſily raiſed up) ſucceeds. And indeed from thence the aforeſaid inordinations about the <hi>Diapnoe</hi> do chiefly ariſe, for as much as the ſenſitive Soul, being either not ſtrong or not munited enough, lyes too open to injuries of the external Air; and ſo is diſturbed at its more ſtrong approach in this or that part, or together in its whole <hi>Hypoſtaſis,</hi> and is forced into irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities not preſently to be recovered. Further hence alſo the flamie part of the Soul is wont to be affected and moved, by conſent no leſs then by its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per paſſion or Idiopathic becauſe of an improportionate incountring of Air. For that the Fibres, and nervous Branches being carried into Corrugations and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions, the Sanguiferous Veſſels twining about them are by them variouſly ſtraitned, that for that reaſon the Blood is compelled into inordinate fluctuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Moreover the bloody Maſs by it ſelf very much purges forth its evills both as to its inkindling, and alſo as to the diſpoſition of its depraved tranſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:40331:70"/> In reſpect of the former the vital flame growing about the ſuperficies of the Body, is wont to be compelled by its more ſharp or hard blowing into nod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings and trepidations and various inequalities, which ſhake the whole Soul. Then it is commonly enough known that there is nothing more can endanger the mixture of the Blood than a vitiated <hi>Diapnoe</hi> or tranſpiration: for hence Fluxes, and precipitations in the Maſs of its ſeroſity ariſe, from which happen Catharrs, Coughs,<note place="margin">From the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Affection Symptoms pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</note> Aſthmatical, Nepthritick, and Arthritick Paroxyſms.</p>
                        <p>From theſe it will be eaſie to draw forth the formal Reaſon and alſo the cauſes and cures of this Affection of which we now treat. For that any one may contract from cold, or from the incountring of the naked air any where in this or that mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, pain, or numneſs, or Palſy, it ſo comes to paſs becauſe the animal Spirits flowing among the membraneous Fibres being ſtruck and put to flight, are agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into diſtractions: but if that more amply from ſuch a cauſe the <hi>Languor</hi> of the whole body, and caſting down of the ſtrength do happen, not a private handful or Band o'f the Spirits but their whole <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> or the intire ſenſitive Soul ſeems be ſtricken; which being ſtrucken and ſo contracted into a leſſer compaſs and made ſhorter, it ſinks down within the Organs of the Body, and ſuffers its faculties to flag. Beſides theſe, if that a tumor of a little continuance, or a <hi>Phlegmon,</hi> the Toothach, Cough, or Pleuriſy, happen to any one unwarily expoſed to the Air, or if cold, heat preſently following, and feavouriſh burnings ariſe, it is a ſign that the Blood is no leſs affected by the improportionate approach of the Air than the animal Spirits, and therefore its Liquor being diſturbed in motion and enkindling is either diſpoſed to fevouriſh Efferveſcencies, or being looſned in its mixture it is compelled into various fluxes and precipitations of the ſerous Juice. It would be an immenſe and tedious labour to deſcribe here all the Affections or Diſeaſes which owe their original to ſuch a cauſe. Hence proceed the Headach, <hi>Vertigo,</hi> the ſleepy Diſeaſes, the Poſe or ſtuffing of the Head, the Squinzy, the Inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the eyes, Cough, Vomiting, Looſneſs, and abundance of other Diſeaſes; in ſo much that the common people are wont to refer the evident cauſes almoſt of all Diſeaſes to theſe two kinds, to wit, ſurfeting and taking cold.</p>

For if thoſe paſſages being too open do almoſt always gape wide, the Blood and Spirits in the whole or in ſome parts are not enough defenced againſt the encounter of the external Air. Such an amplitude of Pores is natural, and bred in ſome, as thoſe who are indued with ſoft and looſe fleſh, have their skin for the

                        <p>This Diſeaſe although it doth not threaten Death,<note place="margin">Its Cure.</note> yet becauſe it renders life very troubleſome or altogether unprofitable, it highly deſerves a Cure: for which endeavour the curatory Intentions are chiefly theſe three, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, or dejections or impoveriſhments both of the Spirits and of the Blood may be cured.

I received the Hiſtory of this admirable affection, both from many worthy of belief, and (although ſhe did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver conſult me for the recovering of her health) from the ſick Ladies own mouth. However ſhe had taken Remedies from many Phyſicians, and had tryed divers ways of living and the Regiment of the ſix non-naturals, ſhe had drunk almoſt all kinds of Waters, had tryed the Air of others Countries and eſpecially of <hi>France,</hi> but for all that ſhe could do, this notable Lady doth yet labour with this troubleſome diſtillation. Although it will not be eaſy for me to ſhew the Reaſon of this caſe, I being ignorant of what hapned in the beginning, progreſs and alterations of this Diſeaſe. What was to be obſerved from things helpful or hurtful, and only ſeeing her once, ſpeech was had of it only by the by: yet however it may be lawful to ſuſpect that in this,<note place="margin">The reaſon of it.</note> as in other Inſtances of Nature, the <hi>Serum</hi> of the blood, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too apt to go away, leaving the paſſages thorow the Reins, Lymphaeducts, <hi>Glandulas</hi> and other ordinary ways of excretion did affect this by the Pores of the skin occaſionally begun, and afterwards facilitated by a certain habitude, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to obſerve it; to which perhaps may be added that the potency of the fluid Salt in the Blood and the nervous Juice, might cauſe a continual fuſion of the blood, and a more plentiful ſeparation of the <hi>Serum.</hi> To the curing of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, when it being confirmed by a continual habit, and the oeconomy of Nature being wholly inverted by it, I know not whether any Remedy, or any Method of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:40331:71"/> curing would be profitable. And certainly nothing would be propoſed by me if I ſhould by chance ſpeak to her about it. But if that great Remedy for a vitiated <hi>Diapnoe</hi> or Tranſpiration, to wit, change of air, ſhould be repeated, they ſhould not go any more into <hi>France,</hi> but into <hi>Denmark</hi> or <hi>Sweedland.</hi>

                        <p>It will be very appoſite to this buſineſs to diſcourſe a little of the Engliſh Sweat,<note place="margin">Of the Engliſh Sweat.</note> ſometimes paſt peculiar and very deadly to our Countrymen, both at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad. But this Diſeaſe hath not been ſeen in an Age, and that an example of it hath been made known to us only by the writings of others, we ſhall not go about to raiſe any <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> about its nature and cauſes, but after having deſcribed its Hiſtory out of Authors only propoſe by way of commentary our conjectures.</p>
                        <p>The Engliſh Sweat began in the Year 1485 about the beginning of <hi>Auguſt</hi> and laſted to the end of <hi>October;</hi>
                           <note place="margin">The Hiſtory of the Diſeaſe.</note> and although <hi>Sennertus</hi> ſaid that this evill was familiar and contiunal for 40 years one after another to this Region, yet our own Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men both Phyſicians, and Hiſtorians, who then lived or neer that time, have obſerved that it had perfect and great intervals, and that it returned only four times in the ſpace of 66 years, <hi>viz.</hi> 1506, 1517, 1528, 1551, and that it raged ſcarce above ſix months at any time, and that there was always a very wet ſeaſon going before it. But in ſome of thoſe years in which it raged, it made every where great ſlaughters, that in ſome places, every time of its Reign the third part of men were found wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. So great was its malignity that ſo ſoon as it invaded any City, it took away every day five or ſix hundred, and ſcarce one hundred of all the ſick would eſape. I think it good to inſert here an example of the Diſeaſe compendiouſly and metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically deſcribed by <hi>Sennertus,</hi> and conſonant to our own Authors.<note place="margin">An example of the Diſeaſe out of <hi>Sennertus.</hi>
                           </note> Thoſe who were taken with this Diſeaſe, were preſently diſpatch'd without long languiſhing, a <hi>Bubo,</hi> Carbuncle, or Pimples, and grew weak in mind with a great <hi>Languor</hi> of ſtrength with unquietneſs, palpitation of Heart, headach, frequent quick and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal pulſe, with great palpitation of the Heart; and alſo they flowted with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of ſweat and perpetually, which ended not till the Diſeaſe was at an end which hapned within twenty four Hours. For thoſe who would not be pleaſed with ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, nor uſed Cordials, and who bore the heat more impatiently, and took cold, they all ſuddenly dyed within twenty four hours.

Others added that in the whole twenty four hours ſpace he was to abſtain wholly from ſleep. This Diſeaſe becauſe it was wont in ſo ſhort a ſpace to terminate in Life or Death was called by the Phyſitians an <hi>Ephemera</hi> or Fevour of a days ſpace. Thoſe who recovered from this peſtilent Sweat, after they had ſometime continued well, ſometimes fell into it again, yea ſometimes a third time.</p>
                        <p>That we may preſume to deliver a Reaſon of this dire Affection from theſe <hi>Phaenomena,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">The Seaſon of it inquired into.</note> let it firſt be lawful for us to ſuſpect the formal Reaſon and alſo the conjunct Cauſe of this peſtilent <hi>Ephidroſis</hi> to conſiſt in this, that the Blood being infected with the meeting of a certain malignant or venomous matter, and for that cauſe being preſently diſſolved in its <hi>Craſis</hi> and fuſed into ſeroſities, therefore for the moſt quick expulſion of this virulent Mixture it is reſolved into Sweat as the moſt univerſal and moſt ample manner of excretion; whereby indeed if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance it hapned by this ſecretion that all the venomous Particles were preſently driven forth adoors, the Diſeaſe preſently terminated in health; or otherwiſe, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry frequently in Death.</p>
                        <p>But next to it ought to be inquired into whether this malignant matter is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:40331:72"/> firſt in the Blood, or poured into it from ſome other place. If it be ſaid the former it will be ſuppoſed, the Maſs of Blood to have acquired an unquiet putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factive <hi>Diatheſis</hi> even as in the Plague by reaſon of a malignant Conſtitution of the Year and Air; which afterwards breaks forth either of its own accord, when it is brought to a plenitude, or by contagion, as it were enkindled into a dangerous and ofttimes corruptive Turgeſcencie,<note place="margin">The primarie Cauſe.</note> but I cannot ſuſpect the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſo in this malignant Sweat, as this in the firſt place ſhews that no ſigns of a corrupt or much vitiated Blood occur before in or after the Fit. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that this Fevour not very intenſe wants Spots, Pimples, Buboes and other Marks of an envenomed or very much fermenting Blood, moreover it is termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated in a Night and a Days ſpace, which ſcarce ever is wont to happen in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes deeply radicated within the bloody Maſs.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">In the nervous Juice.</note>Wherefore I am rather led to believe the evil of this Diſeaſe to be primitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly founded in the nervous Liquor, and from thence to be communicated to the Blood whilſt it performs the Tragedy of that malignant <hi>Ephidroſis.</hi> For it ſeems that this Humour, watring all the Fibres of the whole Body, and being the Vehicle in all places of the animal Spirits, by reaſon of the intemperateneſs of the Year leaving its due <hi>Craſis,</hi> to wit, a volatile ſaline Spirit degenerates into an acetous Nature, or ſome more vitious and at length malignant Diſpoſition; and as this comes to that ſtate of Depravation, then either of its own accord by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of plenitude or excited by reaſon of the Ferment of Contagion, it conceives a turgeſcency or Flux being ſhaken forth from thoſe irritated parts, and flowing back into the ſanguineous Maſs, it preſently impoyſons the whole, and diſſolves its joynting, and by and by that it might be expelled it incites into that very great eccritick Efferveſcency. Hence copious Sweats (becauſe this is the next and moſt ample way of excretion) break forth; by which extream ſtrugling of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture if perchance it happens that the whole Poyſon be ſent forth again from the Blood into the habit of the Body, and thence caſt forth every where by an univerſal, and for a while continual <hi>Ephidroſis,</hi> Health quickly ſhines forth as fair Weather after the Clouds are wholly diſcuſſed; but if by that fermentation, and endeavour of Secretion into which the Blood is ſtirred up, for the ſake of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling the malignant <hi>Miaſma,</hi> the venomous Particles are not ſuddenly and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly caſt forth, the Maſs of Blood both in a manner deprived of the <hi>Serum,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done in its <hi>Craſis,</hi> not being able to be longer continued to a vital Flame, it vaniſhes.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">The reaſon of the Symptomes.</note>From theſe it is not hard to give the reaſons of its Empirical Cure and to aſſign the Cauſes of the Symptoms. For that the Diſeaſe being urgent, or about the beginning of its aſſault before the Fevour ſeems to be inkindled, preſently an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wonted Languor, a defection of the Mind, an utter overthrow of ſtrength, pain of the Head, Palpitation of the Heart, with a quick, frequent, and unequal pulſe, and other affections of the nervous kind did infeſt the ſick, it was a ſign that the nervous Parts were affected before the Blood, and that from them that evil deduced its original.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. As a more copious Sweat (which was ſometimes both ſymptomatick and alſo critick) did ariſe about the beginning of the Fevour being otherwiſe in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, the reaſon is, that the morbifick <hi>Latex</hi> or Water redounding from the Fibres and nervous Parts into the bloody Maſs, for that cauſe it is preſently at its firſt approach caſt forth, nor ſuffered to ſtay any longer or to be intimately mingled with the Blood. For indeed in a ſtate not very unhealthful, the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Liquor ſcarce ever agrees with the Blood: wherefore if at any time by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain turns that does flow back into this, it is by and by ſhook out again; and before it is infected with a lixivial Tincture being ſent away by the Reins ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites a flood of Limpid Urine, which we have informed you to happen indeed often in Convulſive Affections.<note place="margin">From the like caſe out of which this Diſeaſe ſprings, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloody Dyſente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and the <hi>Diabetes</hi> ariſe.</note> But if the degenerate, or depraved nervous Liquor doth continually flow into the Blood, it produces ſometimes the unbloody Dyſentery, ſuch as we have already deſcribed, ſometimes the <hi>Diabetes</hi> as we formerly ſhewed. But by reaſon of the leſſer and private reſtagnations of the ſame Humour, we have formerly ſhewed that cancrous, running, ſcirrhous, or knotty, and other Tumours of an evil kind do ariſe. But indeed in the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe we now ſpeak of, that nervous Liquor is truly ſo very malignant and peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent that at the firſt touch it empoyſons the Blood, and fuſes it into ſeroſities,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:40331:72"/> to be ſent away quickly by Sweat; for otherwiſe if it were permitted to ſtay in the bloody Maſs for a few Hours and to circulate and be thorowly mixed with it, it would wholly corrupt, and plainly mortifie it. Hence in that method of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, there is ſo great Caution found by frequent experience, that from the firſt aſſault of the Diſeaſe, the Sick immediatly (not ſtaying whilſt their Cloathes may be pulled off and put into Bed) being covered with bed Cloathes are put to Sweat, and continue for 24 Hours an equal <hi>Ephidroſis</hi> excited in the whole Body, and are not ſuffered in the mean time to ſtir neither Hand nor Foot, nor to take food nor ſleep; that is they may do nothing whereby that peſtilent <hi>Latex</hi> may be any more, or intimately mixed with the Blood, or whereby its moſt quick and total excluſion might be hindred. That if this kind of quick plentiful and equal Sudation ſtirred up by the inſtinct of Nature, and regulated by Medicine may be ſo long continued, that the whole Poyſon may exhale thorow the Pores of the Skin, the afflicted preſently grow whole without any cutaneous breakings forth, gentle Feavour, long Infirmity, nightly Sweats and other Conſequences of Vitiated Blood.<note place="margin">Why thoſe who are recovered from this Diſeaſe are obnoxious to fall into it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</note> But for as much as the nervous Liquor after its corruptions ſo purged forth, is apt to be depraved again after the ſame manner, and ſo being moved by reaſon of plenitude or contagion to redound from the nervous Parts into the Blood and in like maner to impoyſon it; therefore ſome after they have been perfectly well have uſually been taken a ſecond time, yea ſometimes a third with the ſame Diſeaſe. There will be no need to add any forms of Medicines in this Caſe, becauſe the whole buſineſs of the Cure, almoſt wholly depends on the right ordering or adminiſtring of the Sick. Beſides it would be very imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to preſcribe Phyſick, and a method againſt ſo unwonted a Diſeaſe which we hope will never return again, and if that it ſhould ever return hereafter, it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain whether the ſame way of curing ought to be obſerved in all things.</p>

                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Cordials and Antidotes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Poyſon were always of common uſe.</note>IN ancient Medicine, and alſo in our yet Vulgar and Empirical, which old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Quackſalvers exerciſe, Medicines called Cordials and Antidotes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Poyſon were always of moſt publick uſe and of a great Rank. The ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of theſe are moſt numerous, their Compoſitions add to the heap, and almoſt fill all the Pages in all the Diſpenſatories both Ancient and Modern. But what has reſpect to the reaſons of their Effects and the way of operating, <hi>viz.</hi> upon what kinds of Particles their Virtues depend, and by what affection either of the Heart, or Blood, or Spirits, or of the other Humours they exerciſe their Powers, concerning theſe I ſay, I find nothing ſaid by Phyſitians or Philoſophers which might at any time ſatisfie a Mind deſirous of Truth. For the unfolding the Virtues of Cardiacks, they do not as in the other part of medicinal Cure inſiſt upon the ſenſible and manifeſt Qualities, but they run to the Occult and Specifick, yea to the Actions of the whole ſubſtance; In the mean time if the thing be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively conſidered, and the true and genuine Reaſons of it be ſearched out, it will eaſily appear, that the notion it ſelf of a Cardiack Remedy is very unfitly framed, and is but a vulgar Error.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Their vulgar Attributes.</note>The Cardiack Remedies are eſteemed to be of that ſort, which ſuccour the Heart labouring after any manner of way; wherefore it is every where ſaid in Authors theſe do notably comfort the Heart, that keeps the Heart unhurt from all putrefaction, yea others relieve the weak or oppreſſed Heart, Cure its fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or trembling, and preſerve it from Corruption. Moreover becauſe in the Peſt, Small Pox, and malignant Fevours, it is believed that the Heart is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted or beſet with Venom or malignity, therefore Remedies, which are wont to give help in thoſe ſickneſſes, are not only called ſimply Cordials but <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexiterions</hi> and <hi>Alexipharmacas</hi> that is Preſervatives or Antidotes againſt Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">From whence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies which defend life are called Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acks.</note>This opinion both of Cardiack and Alexiterian Medicines, ſeems to have riſen from thence, for as much as in times paſt it was thought and is commonly believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Heart is the beginning of all Life and Heat, and for that cauſe that our Life or Death depends upon its immediate Affection: Hence whatſoever things do refreſh the Soul and make us lively and chearful, they are believed to do that, for as much as they are benign and friendly to the Heart; and on the contrary, others to induce ſadneſs and melancholy, for as much as they are enemies and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous to the Heart.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Theſe do not act properly on the Heart.</note>But indeed when as we have ſhown more largely elſewhere, that the Heart is not the ſubject of Life, but that it is chiefly and almoſt only the Blood, and that the Soul it ſelf (upon whoſe exiſtence and action of the Body, Life depends) is founded partly in the Blood and partly in the heap of animal Spirits, it eaſily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that the Remedies which conſerve the Life whole, or reſtore it being in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, do reſpect theſe parts of the Soul, to wit, the Blood and the animal Spirits, rather and more immediately than the Heart: For this is not ſo noble and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal an Inward as it hath been hitherto eſteemed, but a mere Muſcle conſiſting only of Fleſh and Tendons, after the manner of the reſt, and ſerving for the driving about of the Blood: But as often as it is deficient or wanting in rightly performing this Office, this is not its proper fault, but happens by the evil either of the Blood or animal Spirits by which it is actuated.</p>
                        <pb n="115" facs="tcp:40331:73"/>
                        <p>Therefore that the reaſons and manner of working of Medicines which are called Cordials may be known, it behoves us to conſider theſe two things, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, by how many or by which ways chiefly, the Blood being amiſs as to its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindling, or as to its mixture, and not ſeldom being in danger,<note place="margin">But in the Blood and animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</note> requires helping Medicines, by which it may be preſerved or amended. Secondly, by what means the Heart, by reaſon of a defect or fault in the animal Regiment, is hindred or perverted from its due motion, and wherefore Medicines which plentifully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, and more rightly, compoſe the Spirits, are preſcribed.</p>
                        <p>As to the Firſt, the Blood in reſpect of its accenſion either is deficient or exceeds;<note place="margin">How in the Blood.</note> and in either reſpect divers manner of Medicines, to wit, hot or cold, as it were, Oyl or Water are required; and therefore they are commonly called Cordials, although they affect not at all the heart: For although from theſe being taken the motion of the Heart is oftentimes altered, and for that reaſon the Pulſe becomes preſently quicker or ſlower, ſtronger or weaker. Yet this is made ſo, becauſe the motion of the Heart depending altogether upon the in-flowing of the animal Spirits (by a wonderful conſent and cooperation between either part of the Soul) is exactly proportionated according to the accenſion or inkindling of the Blood: Wherefore as the Blood intends or enlarges, or remits or leſſens by taken in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines its efferveſcency or heat; of a ſudden the animal Spirits which agitate the Heart, obſerving exactly its condition, make the Heart to ſhake quicker or flower, and ſo if from the ſame Medicine a <hi>ſyſtaſis</hi> of the animal Spirits be effected, therefore alſo a greater or leſs ſtrong or vehement Pulſe is cauſed, when as in the mean time the virtue of that Medicine reaches no more to the Heart it ſelf, than to the Hand or Foot or to any other Muſcle: Therefore that the firſt claſs of Cardiacks whereby the enormities of the Blood are healed, may be inſtituted, it will behove us to weigh by how many, and by which ways its Liquor is wont to be perverted and depraved, both as to its accenſion and as to its <hi>Craſis,</hi> then what kind of Remedies commonly eſteemed Cardiacks, are required for every one of its evils.</p>
                        <p>In the firſt place therefore, the Blood ſometimes is not enough inkindled,<note place="margin">The Blood offends as to its accenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and <hi>Craſis.</hi>
                           </note> nor is circulated with vigor, as is obſerved in many languid perſons, to wit, ſuch as linger with a long egritude, or ſuch as have had great ſlowings of the Hemorrhoids, or other immoderate Evacuations, or broken with old Age; alſo in ſuch who are very pale and cold in their extreme parts; with a weak Pulſe and decayed ſtrength. The Reaſon of which is,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>1.</hi> When it is leſs inkindled than it ought to be.</note> for that the Blood by reaſon of the ſulphureous Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles being too much conſumed or depreſſed, becomes almoſt vapid and decayed; and from thence is ſo very ſparingly and ſmally inkindled in the Lungs: To which oftentimes is added, that the animal Regiment alſo flagging or growing weary; the Heart being deſtitute of a more full influx of Spirits, does not enough exagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the Blood, whereby it might more lively ferment, and be inkindled.</p>
                        <p>The Remedies to be given in this caſe are generous Wines, Hot Waters,<note place="margin">What Remedies are preſcribed.</note> or more mild diſtilled with Spices, aromatick Powders, Species, and Confections, Chymical Oyls and Spirits, Tinctures, Elixirs, and other things endued with ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituons and ſulphureous Particles, which do more agitate the Blood, and render it more inflammable and turgid; and as they together raiſe up and comfort the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal ſpirits; therefore they make the Heart to beat more lively and ſtrongly. The Forms of theſe are ſet down at the end of this Chapter.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, oftentimes the Blood by reaſon of ſulphureous Particles,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>2.</hi> What alſo when too much enkindled.</note> too much ſoluted and conſtrained into an efferveſcency; is inkindled more than it ought to be, and diſperſeth too ſtrong an heat and very troubleſome through the whole Body: Wherefore that it ſo very much rarefied and flaming forth, may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and at the ſame time fanned within the Veſſels, the Heart ſtriking vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently and ſwiftly, drives about the Blood with great labour and ſtriving: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this caſe there ought to be adminiſtred cooling and temperate Cardiack Remedies, which may quench and allay the fervor of the Blood, and alſo gently refreſh the animal Spirits whereby they may be able to be more ſtrong to perform the preſent task of Life: To which ends are wont to be uſed diſtilled waters of Burrage, Balm, of Couſlip Flowers, Marigolds, the Rinds of the whole Citron, alſo the Syrups and Conſerves of the Flowers and Leaves of the ſame kind of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables, the juices of Sorrel, Citrons, Oranges, mineral Cryſtal, and ſuch like, to which Opiates are very often joyned with ſucceſs; for the force of the Heart

Moreover, that Wines, Beer, and other kinds of Drinks, being almoſt vapid and dead; being anew ſtirred by a fermentation within them do often revive: The reaſon of which is, for that as the corruption of every thing conſiſts in the looſening of the elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Particles and their going away one from another, whatſoever detains them, tending to flight and confuſion, yet in motion and perfect mixture, preſerves that Concrete whole and ſound.

Theſe kind of alterations and preſerving Liquors by art from Corruption, is known by every Plebean; and indeed in the Plague and malignant diſeaſes, Alexipharmacks ſeem to perform the ſame effect: For theſe being often taken, for as much as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually agitate the Blood. and compel it into an higher fermentation, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve its mixture whole, notwithſtanding the influences of the hurtful <hi>miaſmata:</hi> Yea after the malignity being impreſſed, and the <hi>Craſis</hi> of the Blood after the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid manner, being begun to be laxed and looſened, theſe ſort of Remedies being given even to a moving a <hi>Diaphoreſis,</hi> for as much as they decoct the <hi>Miaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata</hi> of the received infection, and induce a new fermentation oppoſite to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther corrupt one, they oftentimes obliterate the impreſſions or the force of the peſtiferous infection.

For in truth, thoſe Medicines are of a very near kin to ſome Cardiacks, yea are ſometimes of common or reciprocal uſe, for as much as ſometimes the vitiated <hi>Craſis</hi> of the Blood cannot be relieved, unleſs that firſt its joynting being unlock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there be a way laid open for the ſending away the ſerous water by the Reins or the Pores of the Skin. Salines do beſt of all perform every of theſe ſcopes of healing: For as we have oftentimes already noted, the opening of every Body both liquid and ſolid, is effected almoſt only with a ſaline Key.</p>
                        <p>We have experimentally declared in the Chapter of the <hi>Diureſis,</hi> how by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the various infuſions of Salts, the coagulation of Milk and its reduction from that ſtate or inhibition are performed, and what analogy they have with the Blood; even as in Milk and in the fluid Blood, ſo likewiſe is it in fixed Metals, and other Minerals: For the Concretion or Compaction almoſt of every thing is from the ſalt of one kind, the diſſolution by ſome of another,<note place="margin">They are chiefly ſalines and of a diverſe kind.</note> which ſnatches into its embraces the firſt Salt, and ſo a precipitation is made by ſome Salt of a diverſe kind whhich deſtroys the combinations of the former. We have before declared theſe things ſo clearly and largely, that there will be no need to repeat them here. That therefore we have placed Salines in Cardiacks, no leſs than in Diureticks and Diaphoreticks, the ſame reaſon is for all: It now remains that we briefly ſhew what are the chief <hi>ſpecies</hi> which belong to that Rank or Cenſe of this kind, and the reaſons and ways of their operating.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. In the firſt place therefore, Cardiacks endued with a volatil Salt,<note place="margin">

Hither alſo ought to be referred the Salt of Vipers, alſo the powder of Toads cloſely calcined, (which I knew very famous and beneficial formerly, in the epidemical peſtilential Fever at <hi>Oxford</hi> in the Year 1643.) with many others. Theſe ſorts of Remedies have called back many from the very jaws of Death, and indeed they are often very beneficial in a diverſe and manifold reſpect, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, for as much as they open the maſs of Blood, too much thickened and ſtraitned by a feveriſh efferveſcency, by meeting with the fixed or acid Salts, and ſnatching them into their embraces; and ſo they promote a ſeparation and excretion of the morbifick matter, both beſides that they relieve the animal Spirits, and ſtir them up when ſlothful to the performing their duty. To which we may add, that theſe Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines in malignant Fevers do overcome, and not rarely extinguiſh the venomous Particles of the morbifick Matter.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The ſecond place among ſaline Cardiacks, ought in right to belong to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies endued with an Alchaliſate or petrifying Salt,<note place="margin">

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:40331:75"/> which common Experience witneſſes to be very often given with ſucceſs: And the reaſon of the help ſeems to conſiſt in this, that the Particles of the Alchal Salt in the Medicine, meet with the Particles of the acid Salt in our Bodies, and by and by they intimately joyn together, and ſo deſtroy their fierceneſſes, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other wicked combinations. To the claſs of theſe ſort of Cardiacks alſo <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Armenius,</hi> Lemnian ſealed Earth, and other Marls are deſervedly ranked, not therefore however, that they ſuccour (as the vulgar ſay) the ſick Heart, but for as much as they deſtroy the powers of the acid or fixed Salt, either in the <hi>Viſcera</hi> or in the maſs of Blood, and preſently allay or correct the enormities produced by them.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. If I ſhould exclude from this Rank of Cardiacks acetous Medicines, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with a fluid Salt,<note place="margin">

For the curing of malignant Fevers, Theriacal and Bezoartick Acetes are highly cryed up, yea Vinegar or ace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous things are put into waters diſtilled for that uſe. For the ſame reaſon the ſpirits of Vitriol, the juices of Citrons, of Pomegranates, of Wood-ſorrel with many others of the ſame kind, are eſteemed in the number of Cordials and <hi>Alexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pharmacons;</hi> and indeed by good right, becauſe theſe do beſt of all diſſolve the combinations of the fixed Salt with the aduſt Sulphur, and overcome their fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes; and therefore by theſe ſort of Remedies, the coagulations and extravaſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Blood that are wont to happen in malignant Fevers, are often pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented or cured.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. For the ſame or the like Reaſons, by which the aforeſaid ſalines, others alſo whoſe <hi>baſis</hi> is a fixed Salt,<note place="margin">

By what reaſon thoſe endued with a fixed or lixivial Salt, take away or correct the enormities of the acid Salt reigning in the <hi>Viſcera</hi> and the Blood, we have ſhown before.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Salt Nitre by good right is ranked with Cardiacks, ſeeing that without its Particles inſpired with the Air the Life of Animals could not ſubſiſt:<note place="margin">
                              <hi>5.</hi> In a nitrous Salt.</note> But this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken inwardly at the Mouth is eſteemed a famous <hi>Antepyreuticon,</hi> for as much as it takes away the thirſt, and greatly allays the feveriſh heat, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it effects, not only by helping the miſtion of the Blood but alſo its ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion or enkindling. We have elſewhere ſhewed, that for the making of flame, together with the ſulphureous Particles, nitrous are required, and by how much more plentiful they are, the more clear and bright it burns. Wherefore when the matter enkindled, which conſiſts for the moſt part of Sulphur, with Salt and Earth mixed together ſends forth but an obſcure flame vitiated with Smoak and Soot, if that Nitre be caſt in, it preſently becomes ſplendid and temperate and ſhines forth with a brightneſs. In like maner we think it to be in Fevours when the Blood, being ſtuft with aduſt Feculencies, fumes forth with a ſuffocating heat, rather than openly flames forth, Particles of Nitre being taken in at the mouth, and carried into the blood, by and by make it to burn more clearly and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore beneficial or benign: to the end that the joynting of its liquor being more opened, its excrements both ſerous and fuliginous may go away freely. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our <hi>Verulamius</hi> truly obſerves that the Particles of Nitre being carried into the Ventricle and alſo inſpired together with the Air conduces very much to the maintaining and the prolonging of our Life.</p>
                        <p>Theſe are the chief kinds of Cardiack Medicines, whoſe operation is chiefly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Maſs of Blood, whoſe cloſe or too ſtrict joynting, and thickning by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual concoction, they ſomewhat fuſe and open, that there may be a way opened for the morbifick matter: or they hinder the Blood from putrefaction being diſſolved by an heterogeneous and malignant mixture, and broken into venemous portions and therefore obnoxious to ſtagnations, and corrupt Coagulations; for as much as the Particles of theſe Cardiack Alexiterions being carried into the Blood, and confuſed with it, in the circulating notwithſtanding not being aſſimilated by it, or overcome, they every where riſe againſt the venomous Particles, and either overcome them, or expel them forth adoors; to the end that the bloody Maſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:40331:75"/> freed from all malignity, and extricated from all coagulations, might quickly recover its priſtine Diſpoſition.

Then in the ſecond place the paſſage from the Ventricle into the blood is not, as hath been formerly thought, ſo long, or is carried by ſo many <hi>ambages</hi> or turnings, and windings, that there ſhould be any fear leſt the virtue of the Medicine ſhould be loſt in the way; but in a moment is carried from the ends of theſe into thoſe: For as we have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved above, innumerable ſanguiferous Veſſels thickly planted do cover the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior nervous Coat of the Ventricle, by which reaſon not only cathartick Medicines, but whatſoever others being deſtinated for the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> or the Brain, yea for the uttermoſt border of the Body, not being yet gone forth from the Ventricle, do begin their operations in the blood.</p>
                        <p>So much for Cardiacks ſo commonly called for that they reſtore the Blood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing depraved as to its accenſion or mixture, to wit,<note place="margin">

But moreover ſome Medicines, that are known by the name of Cordials, for as much as they firſt and more immediately ſhew or exert their Energies upon the Animal Spirits, and ſo they erect, vigorate or compoſe either ſome portion, or the whole <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> of the ſenſitive Soul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too much contracted, depreſſed or otherwiſe diſturbed. And indeed theſe ſorts of Remedies do as it were, although more remotely, affect the heart it ſelf: For that when from theſe being given, the whole ſenſitive Soul is elevated, and more largely expanded, alſo the ſpirits deſtinated for the <hi>praecordia,</hi> do ſlow into them more plentifully, and actuate them more lively; and therefore the Pulſe before weak and ſlagging, preſently ſtrikes more ſtrongly, and the Blood is driven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with a greater force. Theſe ſort of Medicines being eſteemed by a certain right for Cardiacks, do not much differ as to the matter from other Vitals, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſpecting the Blood: Yea ſome of them are common to either kind.<note place="margin">Theſe are of a twofold kind.</note> As to the means of affecting theſe latter, may be aptly reduced to two heads, and for as much as they are either gentle or ſharp, they follow the ſame ſcope, to wit, they either ſet up and confirm as it were by gentle ſtroking and ſoft handling the animal Spirits, or elſe by vexing them and urging them as it were with prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings or Goads, they compel them to more quick and ſometimes to more regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar motions,</p>

Theſe and the like, as volatil Salts and empyreumatick or ſtrong ſmelling Chymical Oyls to put to the Noſe, is expedient, as alſo in ſudden defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Soul, to ſprinkle cold water on the Face, to ſhake very much the Body, to pull the Noſe, and ſometimes to ſtrike or buffet the Body, avails. Theſe kind of Adminiſtrations bring help, for as much as they ſtir up or exſuſcitate the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits oppreſſed or diſtracted, or doing ſome other thing beſides their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Office, and then command them being expanſed, and as it were, ſet again into order, to their former Offices. But that ſome ſuppoſe that help to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from hence, for that the Blood being hindred ſomewhere in its courſe, and ſtagnating chiefly within the <hi>praecordia,</hi> brings forth the aforeſaid affections, and is reſtored into motion by thoſe Remedies and means of Adminiſtrations: I ſay, that the cauſe of thoſe Affections and the Cure, depends only ſecondarily and mediately upon the Blood: But that firſtly the ſtagnation of the Blood proceeds from the animal motion of the Heart being ſtopped, and that the impediments of that are not to be taken away, but by the reſtitution of this. The various kinds of Medicines eſteemed for Cardiacks being now rehearſed, and their manner and ways of working on the Blood or Spirits, or both of them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, being (as I think) rightly drawn or deſigned, it yet reſts that we put down ſome ſelect Forms of them, appropriated by Phyſicians to every one of the aforeſaid Intentions.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Kinds and Forms of Cardiacks.</head>
                        <p>BEcauſe we have diſtinguiſhed Medicines commonly eſteemed for Cardiacks into two kinds, <hi>viz.</hi> ſome which chiefly and more immediately affect the Blood,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>1.</hi> Cardiacks in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion of the Blood.</note> and others the animal Spirits; in their firſt rank we have placed thoſe which are deſtinated for the regulating the enkindling of the Blood, which compel its too cold liquor and ſlow in motion to grow more hot, and being exalted or increaſed with more plenty of ſulphureous Particles, more abundantly to be inkindled and to flame forth: Of which ſort are brisk Wines, ſtrong Waters, diſtilled Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, Spirits and Tinctures of Saffron, <hi>Elixir Vitae,</hi> of <hi>Quercetan,</hi> the tincture of ſalt of Tartar, of Steel, and other things filled with Spirit and chiefly with plenty of Sulphur, of which ſometimes theſe, ſometimes thoſe may be taken at the pleaſure of every patient. As often as by reaſon of the Bloods being but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle inkindled, and for that cauſe too much heaped up and almoſt ſtanding ſtill within the <hi>praecordia,</hi> a languor and wearineſs of Spirits, with a great oppreſſion of the Heart do infeſt: in this caſe <hi>Aqua mirabilis,</hi> Clove, Cinamon, and Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood Waters, compounded with the Rinds of Oranges, and diſtilled with Wine, are convenient. To which is ſometimes added a doſe of ſome Spirit, <hi>Elixir,</hi> or Tincture.</p>
                        <p>But here is need of great caution,<note place="margin">The abuſe of theſe is deſcribed.</note> leſt theſe kind of Cordials be ſo often indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: For I have known many both men and women, by the often uſe of theſe to fall into this evil cuſtom, that they were neceſſitated oftentimes in a day to drink a draught of ſtrong Wine, Spirits, or of ſome ſtrong Waters. Moreover their Doſes (becauſe Nature being little accuſtomed to extraordinaries, doth not long endure their Contents) daily to increaſe, and often to repeat; ſo that at length the Stomach was not able to ſuffer or digeſt any moderate thing, ever expecting ſtronger and hotter things: But ſome <hi>Viſceras</hi> and eſpecially the Liver, are ſo dryed and roſted, that the Blood being waſted as to its proviſion, and depraved as to its <hi>Craſis,</hi> a morbiferous <hi>Cacochymia</hi> or ſhortning of Life follows there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</p>
                        <p>Many and various are the occaſions for which many people are brought into this moſt evil cuſtom of ſipping Cardiack Liquors:<note place="margin">Upon what occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions this is wont to grow Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary.</note> For beſides ſudden languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ſtirred up perhaps, by great ſorrow, cruel labour, immenſe Sweats, or ſharp grief; moreover if at any time Aliments not agreeable, do bring a trouble or nauſeouſneſs to the Stomach, or by reaſon of a convulſive <hi>Diatheſis,</hi> a <hi>ſyncope</hi> or inſenſibleneſs ſeems to threaten: Further, for many other cauſes it is a uſual thing to take vinous Spirits or <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> though very improperly ſo called, then after ſuch kind of Cordials being often taken, they begin to be agreeable and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, by every ſup of them the maſs of Blood being a little more enlarged and more inkindled, it cauſes the <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> of the whole Soul to be amplified and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited into a certain rejoycing; which afterwards ſinks down again, but the Soul mindful of that complacency and not content with its preſent condition, at length affects the ſame, and by and by looks earneſtly for the ſame to be taken again: Wherefore for every trouble of the Body or Mind, as ſoon as the Spirits begin a little to flag, a draught of Cordial Waters is ſought for to erect them preſently, and if it be ready at hand it is drunk, and ſo by reaſon of often ſtretching forth the Sails of the Soul to no purpoſe, the fabrick of the Body as of a Ship, periſhes and decays. Nor does this evil Cuſtom grow in uſe with Gluttons and great drinkers only, but ſometimes learned men and very fair and ingenious Women, by often ſipping Spirits and ſtrong Waters, whereby they might the better fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh and exhilarate the quickneſs of their mind, ſpoyl and very often quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy their own health. There will be no need to add here any forms of theſe kind of Cardiacks, ſo well and commonly known, it ſeems enough to have here noted the abuſe of them.</p>

                           <note place="margin">Cardiack Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are wont to be ſo called.</note>AFter the Cardiack Medicines ſo called, though improperly, follows to be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled the cardiack Paſſion, in which indeed the Heart labours and therefore truly requires cordial Remedies. Under this true name are commonly noted two Affections ſomewhat divers in themſelves;<note place="margin">The trembling and the beating of the Heart.</note> to wit, the trembling of the Heart and its Palpitation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in either of which Affections the motion or inordinate pulſe of the Heart ſeems to be in a manner convulſive: but yet the inordination of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer conſiſts in the frequency of its Vibrations, and of the other in their vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. We will firſt ſearch into the Reaſon of this latter, and then we will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour alſo to ſhew the knowledge of the other, and laſtly the cure of them both.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">The deſcription of the latter.</note>The Palpitation of the Heart is ſometimes ſo vehement and great, as not only manifeſtly to be perceived by touch, but alſo to be beheld by the eyes, yea ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times may be heard at a certain diſtance. Moreover it hath been related by cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible Authors, that by the more vehement vibration of the Heart and percuſſion of the Ribs they have ſometimes been broken or in younger people driven forth and continued protuberous or ſticking out.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">The Reaſon of it ſearched into.</note>But truly although this motion may be perceived by ſo many of the ſenſes, yet it does not appear to reaſon what part is ſo moved, that it ſhould make the left ſide of the Breaſt to leap out by every one of its ſtrokes. I do believe that all both
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:40331:78"/> the learned and unskilful, will ſay with one conſent that the part ſo moved and ſtrongly ſhaken is the Heart it ſelf; but I ask whether it be the whole frame of the Heart, or any part of it, that ſo leaps forth, and tranſgreſſes the wonted Sphear of its vibration? If it be ſaid it is its whole Body that is ſo carried forth, I would have them ſay whether this is made in its <hi>Syſtole</hi> or <hi>Diaſtole:</hi> Certainly not the firſt,<note place="margin">It proceeds not from the Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive motion of the Heart it ſelf.</note> for whilſt the heart is contracted, as may appear by inſpection, its bigneſs as to all its parts is leſned; no more can it be ſaid in <hi>Diaſtole,</hi> becauſe in that ſtate the Heart returns only to its ordinary and natural ſite and magnitude, and remains a little time in it. Hence ſeeing that according to the Laws of its vibration how ſtrong or increaſed ſoever, the Heart cannot ſo palpitate, and leap forth; (which alſo further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, becauſe in a ſevouriſh Fit when it beats moſt vehemently, it does not leap forth and ſtrike the ſides) I was once ſuſpicious that during that affection it did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a convulſive motion, and quite contrary to its ordinary motion; whereby being agitated like a convulſive Member, the Heart was wholly elevated and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved forth of its place. But the Neurology being more fully underſtood I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently fell from this opinion, becauſe it is certain that the Heart can no ways be lifted up or carried forth, by any other Muſcle, beſides it own moving Fibres. Wherefore conſidering this thing more ſeriouſly, it at length came into my mind that whilſt the Heart is contracted, for the excluding the Blood from its confines and that its tops and ſidesyeild on every ſide and are brought nearer; if notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all the blood be not forthwith wholly caſt forth and ſent away at every <hi>Syſtole,</hi> there will be a neceſſity for the roots of the Veſſels ſilled to the hight and very much extended to leap forth with a certain force, then by reaſon of the verberation here made, the whole frame of the Heart to be greatly ſhaken.</p>
                        <p>Truly that this Affection doth ariſe from ſome ſuch cauſe ſometimes I have ſeen confirmed of late by an anatomical obſervation.<note place="margin">It ſometimes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>flux of the Blood into the Arteries being hindred.</note> A godly and known divine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that he had lived obnoxious to the palpitation of the Heart, at very many times now of its own accord now occaſionally, he began at length to be afflicted with it continually night and day, with a grievous purſineſs, and then within a few months being worn out with the aſſiduity of this moſt troubleſome Diſeaſe, he dyed. His dead Body being opened, the right corner of his Heart appeared tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid with concreted blood, a little lap of which being hugely increaſed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended contained great plenty of clotted blood. The Reaſon of theſe contents did preſently appear, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe the Lungs being hugely obſtructed and ſtuffed with black extravaſated gore ſtagnating every where, were not able to admit of the blood continually to be thruſt forth from the Ventricle: wherefore whilſt the Heart highly labouring for its total excluſion is contracted inward towards the middle by every <hi>Syſtole,</hi> and as to its magnitude is diminiſhed; its <hi>Baſis</hi> by reaſon of the blood there heaped up and ſticking or reverberating in its paſſage, being very much filled bunches forth, and becauſe of the greatneſs of the Lap, or little Ear; being more tumid, ſhakes more largely and reaches to the ſide.</p>
                        <p>But indeed the Heart is ſeen to beat not only from this cauſe;<note place="margin">Beſides it is wont to ariſe from other cauſes.</note> becauſe this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is not always conſtant and perpetual, but for the moſt being wandring, and uncertain infeſts at certain times, and then of its own accord or by the uſe of Remedies ceaſes. Beſides it has hapned to ſome frequently whoſe Lungs are whole enough and free from any infection.</p>
                        <p>However although this Diſeaſe may ariſe from divers cauſes, yet we judge the ſame means of affecting to be even in them all. For it ſeems that the Heart only palpitates, for as much as whilſt the Cone and ſides being contracted together, it is ſtraitned in its <hi>Syſtole,</hi> the <hi>Baſis</hi> with the Roots of the Veſſels being enlarged by reaſon of the blood there heaped up and ſometimes adhering or repercuſſed, ſwells out or is tumefied. In truth from hence it appears that the courſe of the Blood in this place is ſomewhat hindred or beaten back, becauſe whilſt the Heart is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently and ſtrongly ſhaken in the ſide, the Artery in the wriſt for the moſt part beats languidly and weakly, as it were containing but a ſmall River of Blood. Therefore as the conjunct cauſe or formal reaſon of this Diſeaſe,<note place="margin">This affection for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                                 <desc>••</desc>
                              </gap>ſt part de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the vitiouſneſs of the Blood or of the Veſſels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Heart.</note> conſiſts altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſtopping and aggeſtion of the Blood about the <hi>Baſis</hi> of the Heart and Roots of the Veſſels, it follows that we muſt inquire after how many ways and for what other cauſes this kind of affection is wont to be produced.</p>
                        <p>Concerning theſe as we do not lay the fault much on the Fleſh or the proper moving Fibres of the Heart, this Evil chiefly ſeems to be imputed either to the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:40331:79"/> Blood or to the Veſſels hanging to the Heart. The reaſon of the firſt is plain e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, for as much as thoſe indued with a watry Blood or leſs apt to an efferveſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or enkindling, as Virgins labouring with the green Sickneſs or chachectical men or women, are found for the moſt part obnoxious to this Diſeaſe, and are wont to be troubled with its aſſault conſtantly upon every the leaſt quick motion of the Body.<note place="margin">The reaſon of the former explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> The cauſe of which is, for that the Blood conſiſting of ſluggiſh and not active enough Particles, is not caſt forth freely and expeditiouſly from the Boſoms of the Heart, but part of it oftentimes remains in them and eaſily ſtagnates: therefore as often as by the motion of the Body more plenty is brought into them that its whole proviſion cannot be caſt forth by every <hi>Syſtole,</hi> the Heart labouring with mighty ſtrugling drives it forth ſcarce beyond its <hi>Baſis</hi> and the roots of the Veſſels; where when it is heaped together, and remaining a little while, makes the parts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it to bunch out, it cauſes the cardiack Paſſion together with a <hi>Dyſpnoea</hi> or ſhortneſs of Breath.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>2.</hi> In the other caſe either the Veſſels are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed or they are affected with a Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note>Beſides this cardiack affection does oftentimes infeſt ſome, notwithſtanding they are indued with a very hot Blood and apt to be readily enough inkindled or to ferment. This evil is frequent and familiar with very many much troubled with the Hypochondriack, Hyſterick, or otherwiſe convulſive Paſſion: wherefore in theſe caſes we have deſervedly ſuſpected the Arteries belonging to the Heart to have been in the fault. By what means their obſtruction hindring the free ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux of the Blood from the heart,<note place="margin">An example of the former is propoſed.</note> cauſes the palpitation of the Heart, the Hiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory now recited manifeſtly declares: beſides the ſhutting up of thoſe Veſſels, and infarſions or ſtuffings up being by other ways excited may produce the ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. I knew an old Man accuſtomed for many years to the often drinking of ſtale ſtrong Beer, and alſo of Wine, was wont to ſuffer frequent aſſaults of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid Diſeaſe; who dying afterwards with an ulcerous inflammation of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, with daily vomiting, with languor of Spirit, and other Symtoms; when I opened his dead body, I found the Trunk of the great Artery aſſoon as it was gone from the Heart to be bony or rather ſtony and its ſides to be greatly compreſſed, that a chink only being left,<note place="margin">And diverſe kinds noted.</note> not half the torrent of the Blood could flow that ſhould do. So that I might very well aſcribe the cardiack Paſſion ſo very troubleſome to him to this cauſe. But it is probable this Affection does ſometimes proceed from the Blood clotting within the Boſom of the Heart, and the adjoyning Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and being concreted as it were into a fleſhy Cruſt.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">How the palpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Heart is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>But beſides theſe, for as much as the cardiack Palpitation is wont oftentimes to be accompanied (as we but now intimated) with other convulſive Affections, we may ſuſpect alſo that its cauſe is ſometimes meerly convulſive. We have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſhewed out of anatomical obſervations in our Neurologie, the Nerves, and nervous Branches almoſt innumerable in very many places and cheifly neer the <hi>Baſis</hi> of the Heart to be folded and wound about the Trunks of the Arteries; the Uſe and Actions of which we think to be of this Nature that the divers manner of Heats, Fluxes and Refluxes, yea ſometimes Stagnations of the Blood that are wont to be excited by reaſon of the vehement affections of Anger, Fear, Joy, Sorrow, and ſuch like, may ſo come to them, for as much as theſe little nervous Strings do variouſly ſtrain, preſs together, or perhaps ſometimes wholly ſhut up theſe ſanguiferous Veſſels. Beſides it is not very improbable that by reaſon of thoſe Veſſels being convulſively affected, and a little longer conſtrained, ſo that they hinder the free exilition of the Blood from the Heart, the aſſaults of the cardiack Palpitation may ariſe. Indeed we may very well impute both this, and thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſſions of the Heart to ſuch a cauſe; but as to the means of doing it we a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſeem to differ from that opinion.<note place="margin">For what uſe the many nerves are inſerted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Coats of the Arteries.</note> For after I had weighed more exactly the uſe and actions of the Nerves. I underſtood at length that they or their ſhoots did not draw or conſtrain any thing at all, but that all this buſineſs was perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med wholly by the fleſhy Fibres, and that the nerves only do convey to theſe moving parts, new and abundance of Spirits, and alſo the inſtincts of approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing motions: which like kind of Office they performs towards the membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Fibres for the buſineſs of Senſation.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">The Arteries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indued with moving Fibres.</note>Therefore whilſt I did ſeriouſly ſearch for what uſes ſo many Nerves ſowed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the Coats of the Veſſels did ſerve, at length I found theſe Arteries by their own ſtrength to contract and dilate themſelves even like other <hi>Praecordia,</hi> and for the performing their motions both naturally and pathetically, both the plenty of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:40331:79"/> and the means of Inſtincts to be carried through thoſe Nerves. For by ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomical obſervation it plainly appears that the middle Coat of every Arterie, is clearly muſcularie, and through the whole conſiſts of fleſhy Fibres as thoſe of the Ventricle, the Inteſtines, and ſome other <hi>Viſceras,</hi> which ringy Fibres com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing about with a thick <hi>Series,</hi> as it were of ſmall Hairs, the Pipe or Tube of the Arterie, do atchieve without doubt their proper <hi>Syſtoles</hi> and <hi>Diaſtoles,</hi> even as the Heart it ſelf. Wherefore in the firſt place,<note place="margin">Is moved like other Muſcles and the Heart it ſelf.</note> whilſt the Cardiack Fibres and then theſe Arterious, are ſucceſſively, and one <hi>Series</hi> after another contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there is a neceſſity that the Blood ſhould be rapidly driven along, from one bound to another. Wherefore it is not for nothing that ſome Phyſitians have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed alſo a pulſifick Facultie to the Arteries: for that it is very improbable that the circuit of the Blood is performed by the impulſe of the Heart as it were the ſtroke of a Bar. It is more likely by much that the Arterie in its whole paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage being contracted as it were at the back of every ſanguineous Flood, ſhould urge it every where thorow thoſe little ſmaller rivulets and more narrow ſpaces. According to this ordinary rite in equally driving about the Blood, the Arteries ſeem to have their conſtant turns of <hi>Syſtoles</hi> and <hi>Diaſtoles.</hi> Which although they are very ſwift, more quick than the twinkle of an Eye, yet they are made ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively thorow all the parts of the Arterious Tube.<note place="margin">And is often af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with a Convulſion or Cramp.</note> But as we have noted that the equal courſe of the Blood is diverſly broken off, and diſturbed according to the force of aſſaults of the Paſſions, there will be a neceſſity that it is only ſo done for as much as the Arteries (by reaſon of an Inſtinct given through the Nerves to the moving Fibres) being ſuddenly conſtrained in divers places, they either ſtop, or repreſs, or drive to and fro more impetuouſly, the ſanguineous Flood. In Fear, ſudden Sorrow, Shame, Love and other Affections bringing in a conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation or great confuſion of Mind, it is probable that the Trunk of the <hi>Aorta</hi> is ſo contracted and ſtraitned by theſe Fibres ſuddenly and for ſome time drawn together, that the Blood very hardly and not but by very little Portions drops forth from the Boſome of the Heart.<note place="margin">From whence the palpitation of the Heart often ariſes.</note> Wherefore from it there heaped up and ſtagnating, there is preſently felt a mighty burthen, and a great oppreſſion: then if to this ſtop of the Blood, a ſtrong and vehement pulſation of the Heart for the caſting forth of the Blood follows, it will be neceſſary by reaſon that the Blood being ejected at every <hi>Syſtole</hi> to the <hi>Baſis</hi> of the Heart, and there repercuſſed, for thoſe parts to be very much diſtended, and for that reaſon the cardiack Palpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to be produced.</p>
                        <p>But as vehement Paſſions of the Mind do bring this affection almoſt upon every one, ſo Hypochondriacal Perſons,<note place="margin">Wherefore this affection is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar to Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondriacal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</note> and ſuch as are convulſively diſpoſed are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to its aſſaults upon every light occaſion, yea ſometimes without any manifeſt cauſe. But in ſome the Splanchnick and Cardiack Nerves are wont often to be beſet with a morbifick matter; ſo that it being moved by reaſon of plenitude or irritation, compells the Spirits inhabiting thoſe parts, and neer about, frequently into Convulſions and inordinate Contractions; it ſtill happens becauſe that the Nerves being inſerted in the Roots of the Cardiack Arteries from ſuch a cauſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, alſo the Fibres of theſe Veſſels being convulſively affected, and contracted therewith, by which means it is ſaid to ſtir up the cardiack Palpitation. By what means the cardiack Nerves are irritated from a neer or remote cauſe, by a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bifick matter ſubſiſting either in the Head neer to the Nervous beginning, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>Praecordia</hi> or <hi>Hypocondria,</hi> and are carried into Convulſions or Cramps of divers Kinds, we have ſhown in ſome other place, from whence the cauſes of the Cardiack Palpitation may be deduced as often as the ſame ſhall be alſo Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive.</p>
                        <p>As to what belongs to the cure of this Diſeaſe,<note place="margin">Its Cure is propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</note> as the cauſes of it are various and manifold, a divers way of Cure alſo ought to be ſhown. For what ſome affirm that theſe Remedies commonly called Cordials do refreſh the Heart, and are believed to bring help to it being ſick, in ſome caſes it is contrary both to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and common experience to give them. Therefore as we have above declared that the palpitation of the Heart proceeds from the fault of the Blood or of the Arteries hanging to the Heart, and hinted the various means of either of theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing affected, it now remains that we accommodate an apt method of Curing of every kind of this Diſeaſe, together with ſelect Forms of Remedies.</p>

                           <head>Of the Trembling of the Heart.</head>
                           <p>The Trembling of the Heart (which alſo commonly goes under the name of a Cardiack paſſion) is an affection diſtinct, yea divers from its Palpitation.<note place="margin">How the tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Heart differs from its palpitation.</note> For in it its own fleſhy or moving Fibres ſeem to be affected by themſelves, and not to ſubſiſt as in the other Affections, in a morbifick cauſe in the Blood or in the Cardiack Arteries.</p>
                           <p>The Trembling of the Heart may be well deſcribed,<note place="margin">Its deſcription.</note> that it is a Spaſmodick Convulſion or rather a trepidation of its Fleſh: by which the moving Fibres do moſt ſwiftly effect, but yet being but half contracted, quick, but broken and as it were but half turnes of <hi>Syſtoles</hi> and <hi>Diaſtoles;</hi> ſo that the Blood can both be brought into, and alſo carried out of the Boſoms of the Heart, but only by very little Portions.</p>
                           <p>Becauſe that this Affection may be a convulſive motion of ſome Muſcle,<note place="margin">The reaſon of this depends upon the Doctrine of Myologie or knowledge of the Muſcles.</note> 
                              <hi>viz.</hi> of the Heart, to the more full Knowledge of it, what we have diſcourſed in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other place concerning the Muſculary Motion, and alſo concerning Convulſive Affections ought to be referred hither. That I may not ſeem tedious by repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting many things, in a Word know that every Muſcle conſiſts of two Tendons and a fleſhly Belly; and that Contraction is from thence performed for as much as the Animal Spirits leap forth from either of the Tendinous Fibres into the fleſhy,<note place="margin">The ſum of which is delivered.</note> which whilſt they blow up and intumifie, they therefore make ſhort and render contractive; but the motion being ended, the Spirits return into the Tendons, and the fleſhy Fibres are relaxed.</p>
                           <p>As the Motive Function is double, to wit, ſpontaneous and merely natural, in the former we ſay the Spirits are called forth by the government of the Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite from the Tendons into the fleſhy Fibres, and do remain within them in acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on till they are diſmiſſed by its beck, but then being returned they remain quiet in the Tendons until they are again commanded forth, hence it is that their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and times of reſt are unequal, uncertain, and variouſly to be determinated at our pleaſure.</p>
                           <p>In the Function meerly natural it is much otherwiſe; for that the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are carried forth from the Tendons into the Fleſh by a perpetual turn or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant reciprocation, and a ſhort contraction being made they preſently leap back from theſe into thoſe, and ſo viciſſively; after which manner the Heart it ſelf, the Arteries, and Organs of reſpiration, yea the fleſhy Fibres of the Ventricle and Inteſtines, unleſs they are otherwiſe determinated by reaſon of their objects, are agitated by perpetual <hi>Syſtoles</hi> and <hi>Diaſtoles.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>According to theſe ordinary means,<note place="margin">The convulſive motions of the Muſcles are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated.</note> the offices of the motive Function of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are performed, notwithſtanding which they are wont to be diverſly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted or diſturbed according as the Animal Spirits the performers of thoſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are variouſly affected. For indeed it appears plain enough that the Inſtinct of every contractive motion coming from every muſcle is conveyed by the Nerves from the Brain or the Cerebel or little Brain (in the hinder part of the Head) according to the command of the Appetite or the indigency of Nature; <hi>viz.</hi> The Animal Spirits abounding within their Pipes, being ſtirred up according to an Impreſſion delivered from the Head, and moved in the whole <hi>Series,</hi> preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly awaken others inhabiting the Tendons, and provoke them into proportionate motions, almoſt after the ſame manner as if any one ſhould ſet fire of a Train of Gunpouder at a diſtance with a lighted Match. Therefore ſo long as thoſe Spirits implanted both in the beginning, <hi>viz.</hi> Within the <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, and in the way, <hi>viz.</hi> the nervous Pipes, and in the end, <hi>viz.</hi> within the Tendons do keep right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and orderly, they form, thoſe convey, and theſe at length execute the inſtinct of every motion required by the Soul or Nature: but if the Spirits deſtinated to the motive Function being unnaturally affected within any Dominion are compelled into irregularities,<note place="margin">And diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed.</note> for that reaſon preſently convulſive motions are excited in the members or reſpective muſcles. By what means by reaſon of a morbifick cauſe nigh the nervous Origin in the Head, by what alſo, by reaſon of that planted elſewhere within the nervous Pipes convulſive affections either of the members, or <hi>Viſcera</hi> or <hi>Praecordia</hi> are wont to ariſe, we have in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:40331:81"/> place largely enough declared; <hi>viz.</hi> for that the Spirits flowing within the Nerves being irritated, and ſtruck as it were with a certain fury from ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural cauſe, whilſt they ruſh into theſe or thoſe parts, and carry falſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt ſigns of motions to be ſtirred up, there will be a neceſſity for contractions or violent and convulſive diſtentions in theſe or thoſe Muſcles, or Membranes to be cauſed, we have clearly ſhown the various kinds and formal reaſons of theſe ſort of affections in our <hi>Spaſmologie;</hi> but what was there pretermitted, and belongs to the matter in hand we will now further advert,<note place="margin">Some private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only to the Muſcles.</note> that we grant there are other kinds of Spaſms or Cramps which do ariſe without any preſent or great fault of the <gap reason="foreign">

                              <note place="margin">Two kinds of them ſet down.</note>We meet with two obſervable kinds of this ſort of ſingular and as it were pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Affection: one is commonly enough known in which the ſpirits unbidden do often leap forth from the Tendons, and greatly and grievouſly blowing up the fleſhy Fibres, do not preſently or eaſily recede. The other, although leſs known, yet frequently happens in which the muſculary Spirits are able to remain long, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther within the Tendons, nor within the fleſh, but being highly unquiet, make out of theſe into this and back again in ſpight of Appetite or nature, their very often courſes and recourſes, but even weak and inordinate. Concerning theſe convulſive Affections (becauſe they remain as yet untouched by moſt Phyſicians, and the knowledge of them makes very much for the truly unfolding the cauſes, and the nature of the cardiack Paſſion) I think it worth my labour here, although beyond the matter propoſed, and as it were for Diverſion however to ſet down a few things.</p>
                           <p>
                              <note place="margin">The former com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the Cramp explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note>This former Affection which is properly <gap reason="foreign">

                              </gap> (and both in our <hi>Idiom</hi> and the French is wont to be called the Cramp) for the moſt part ariſes, for that the animal Spirits unbidden do of their own accord leap forth from the Tendons from one or both together into the Belly of the Muſcle, from whence they will not go back preſently after their wonted manner, but ſtaying longer within the fleſhy parts do greatly inflate them, and render them highly contracted; then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe others neither give place to theſe Muſcles, nor conſpire in Contraction, the part becomes ſtill and ſtretched with exceeding great pain. The cauſe of this is, a certain Heterogeneous matter, and inflating, which deſcending thorow the nervous Pipes together with their Juice into the Muſcles, and ſticking to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, renders them Elaſtick and alſo obſtinate; becauſe that they cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained within the tendinous Fibres, but deſiring larger ſpace they run forth into the fleſhy parts, and there remain till their Tumour abates.</p>

                              <note place="margin">The latter is a leaping or trepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of ſome Muſcle.</note>2. To this latter kind of convulſive motion properly belongs the Paſſion, or trembling of the Heart. Further to this Cenſe ought to be referred an affection commonly enough known and familiar to many, to wit, that ſometimes they ſuffer a leaping,<note place="margin">Of which ſort of Affection is the trembling of the Heart.</note> or very frequent and equal trepidations of ſome private Muſcle. to wit, in the Lips, Cheeks, Eyes, or other Members; which after they have indured two or three minutes perhaps ceaſe of their own accord. Not long ſince I was adviſed with by Letters from <hi>France</hi> concerning a certain Gentleman, all whoſe Muſcles thorow his whole Body, did almoſt perpetually uſe ſuch kind of leapings or trepidations, ſo that his outward Fleſh every where leaping forth, imitated exactly the Vibrations of Pulſes of the Heart it ſelf.</p>

                              <note place="margin">Its formal reaſon.</note>The formal Reaſon of theſe kind of Affections, and as of the Cardiack tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſeems to conſiſt in this, for that the animal Spirits belonging to ſome Muſcles being unquiet, and as it were ſtruck with a ſudden fury, continually leap forth from the Tendons into the Fleſh, and return, and iterate by a perpetual change their excurſions and recurſions; in the mean time as they are carried forth only with very ſmall forces that they hardly fill the fleſhy Fibres, and continue in them but a very little ſpace only, although the motive endeavours be very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, yet they are but very weak and ſmall; in ſo much as the Members, and Joynts are not moved out of their place by the ſo perpetually agitated Muſcles, and the Heart during its tremor, how ſwiftly ſoever it be ſhaken, ſcarcely or not at all is able to drive about the Blood; as it plainly appears by the ſmall and as it were trembling Pulſe and failing of all ſtrength.</p>
                           <p>
                              <note place="margin">The Cauſes.</note>As to what belongs to the cauſe of theſe Affections, <hi>viz.</hi> the conjunct, and more remote, by which the muſculary Spirits are made ſo unſtable, or acquire
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:40331:81"/> that deſultorie force; it ſeems to be for that a certain Heterogeneous matter, and elaſtick coming from the Brain and nervous Paſſages, is carried at length into the Muſcles and their tendinous ends; where growing with the Spirits from thence do greatly irritate them, and affect them as it were with a certain fury, ſo that they can ſtand ſtill no where, but run about hither and thither, and in the mean time omit their due tasks, or not ſtrenuouſly perform them.</p>
                           <p>The cauſe of the Cardiack Trembling is commonly caſt upon the Spleen;<note place="margin">Not rightly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the Spleen.</note> for it is vulgarly ſuppoſed that from this <hi>Viſcus,</hi> being obſtructed or being otherways amiſs, foul vapours are elevated to the Heart; which ſtriking it compel it to be ſo ſhaken and to tremble, yea affect it with a certain rigor.</p>
                           <p>Faith to this opinion is confirmed or at leaſt its probability, becauſe Hypocon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driack Perſons (or what is almoſt the ſame, ſplenical) are found to be very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to this Cardiack paſſion. What and how much influence the Spleen has on the <hi>praecordia,</hi> we have already largely declared: From that and partly from what was but now ſaid, it appears plain enough that this opinion, though much receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of the Heart being affected by vapours, is altogether falſe and erroneous.

                           <p>The intermitting Pulſe ought, and indeed deſervedly, to be ranked with the Cardiack Paſſions, becauſe in this affection or at leaſt in ſome kind of it, the Heart it ſelf labours, but in ſomething a diverſe manner than in its palpitation or trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling: For in theſe as to its motion it is amiſs and irregular, in the other, as to its reſt; for it is ſometimes twice as long as it uſes to be according to its ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary courſe.</p>

                              <note place="margin">Two kinds of the intermitting Pulſe.</note>Firſt, we ought to diſtinguiſh this affection, which (unleſs I am greatly deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) hath two diſtinct ways of being made: For although ſometimes the Pulſe does intermit, becauſe the Heart ceaſes for that time from motion; yet beſides the Pulſe being felt ſometimes ſeems to intermit at the Wriſt, whilſt the Heart is perceived to ſhake (as it does in its trembling) moſt ſwiftly and inceſſantly in the Breaſt: The cauſe of which I ſuſpect to be, for that this paſſion of the Heart urging a very little portion only of Blood, is caſt forth at every <hi>Syſtole</hi> into the <hi>Aorta:</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Firſt, that which is exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault of the <hi>Aorta.</hi>
                              </note> Wherefore this being void and growing flaccid, and wanting its load to be moved away; leſt it ſhould act ſo often in vain, it ſometimes intermits its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, and ſeems even as in the unloading of a Ship when the wares are more difficultly, and by ſome let for a time, ſtaid in drawing them forth of the hold, the Porters that carry them are put beſides or pretermit ſome turns of going and coming. Further, in malignant or deadly Fevers, if at any time the Pulſe be quicker and weak, it alſo then intermits, the reaſon of which is not that the Heart ſometimes ceaſes from motion, (for then it moſtly and inceſſantly labours) but for as much as the Blood is not carried with enough plentiful proviſion, by every <hi>Syſtole</hi> into the <hi>Aorta;</hi> wherefore this wanting work to do, ſometimes grows idle.</p>

                              <note place="margin">The ſecond which proceeds from the Heart it ſelf.</note>But moreover the Pulſe ſometime intermits, becauſe the contraction of the Heart it ſelf is ſuſpended for a certain time, or its pauſe is twice longer, which indeed any one may eaſily find in himſelf or another, by putting his hand to the Breaſt, yea thoſe who are ſick as often as the Heart ceaſes from motion, may plainly perceive it in themſelves, by the weight and oppreſſion of the Breaſt. Moreover this affection does not ſo much happen to the languid, thoſe about to dye, or that are dangerous ſick, as to thoſe well enough and as to many things in in good order;<note place="margin">Which does not always betoken Evil.</note> wherefore it ought not always to be taken according to the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the vulgar for a diſeaſe, or for a very pernicious or ſo hurtful a ſign. Theſe who are obnoxious to this, are wont to be troubled for the moſt part alſo with the <hi>Vertigo,</hi> the Headach or convulſive Affections. But this defect of the Heart as to its type is various, for now the periods of Intermiſſion are certain, and determinated to a certain change of the Pulſe, to wit, the third, fourth, fifth, or ſome other more often or more rare, now they are uncertain and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring, as a ceſſation now happens after a few Pulſes, by and by after more. The vibrations of the Artery whilſt they are continued, are well and ſtrong enough, and for the moſt part are equal,<note place="margin">Various Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of it.</note> but yet ſometimes the firſt Pulſation is the greateſt after the intermiſſion, that which ſucceeds a little leſſer, and ſo by degrees they are leſſened until the intermiſſion comes again, then afterwards a great Pulſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, it deſcends again as it were by a ladder to a ceſſation.</p>
                           <p>I have known ſome (ſo much as the buſineſs could be made known to our obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation) that were always endued with an intermitting Pulſe, ſo that I never at any time touching the Artery could find it otherwiſe, and in the mean time they ſeemed well enough and complained of no ſickneſs. But however I have known
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:40331:82"/> others alſo to have had an intermitting and more ſlow Pulſe than ordinary, only when a cruel Headach or ſome more grievous Affection of the Head was preſent or neer at hand.</p>
                           <p>From theſe I think it appears that the cauſe or formal Reaſon of the Affection,<note place="margin">The Cauſe of it.</note> but now deſcribed, does not depend upon the miſtion or <hi>Craſis</hi> of the Blood, but only from the irregular diſpenſation of the animal Spirits from the Cerebel into the Cardiack Nerves, and from thence into the tendons of the Heart: For it may be well ſuſpected that by reaſon of thoſe Nerves being ſomewhat obſtructed, the animal Spirits cannot deſcend to the tendons of this Muſcle with a full Channel or influx: Wherefore as their proviſion is ſomething deficient, the motion of the Heart ceaſes forthwith for one Pulſe, until more plenty of Spirits being reſtored preſently its action is continued: So we have ſeen a Mill driven about by a ſmall Stream, the water ſometimes falling and growing ſcant, to ſtop or go ſlowly for a little time, and preſently when the water flowed or roſe higher, to repeat its rotation or going round.</p>
                           <p>Thoſe whoſe Pulſe is great of it ſelf and ſtrong enough,<note place="margin">

The Arteries aſcending every where in this Coat, firſt from the coronary Veſſels, and then out of the Trunk of the <hi>Aorta</hi> and from its branches are ramified or branched with Veins and Branches in like manner, ſent forth from its hollow.

But it appears this error to have been familiar to ſeveral Phyſicians, to wit, that they have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to many <hi>Viſcera's</hi> and membraneous parts, right, tranſverſe, and oblique Fibres, out of a falſe ſuppoſition that there was in every one of them, an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive, retentive, and expulſive faculty, and that theſe three Offices ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the three orders of Fibres, all which indeed will appear to any diligent enquirer, to have been falſly aſſumed and upon truſt. In the mean time I ſo far aſſent to <hi>Galen,</hi> that I acknowledge four diſtinct Coats of the Artery, yea thoſe to be in this Veſſel even as in the Ventricle, except yet that in the <hi>Viſcera's,</hi> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiform infolding of the Veſſels together with the Glandulous Coat, is placed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the fibrated or muſculary Coat, but in the Artery above it.</p>

                           <p>But that theſe ſanguiferous Veſſels, planted without the muſculary Coat, and complicated among themſelves, do conſtitute as it were a retiform fold, from which only moſt little and very ſmall ſhoots are ſent forth, (as it is alſo about the Ventricle and Inteſtines) when as in many other muſcles, theſe Veſſels are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven with the fleſhy Fibres, and make them therefore to bluſh or ſeem red: The reaſon of this difference ſeems to be, for that it is requiſite for the ſanguiferous Veſſels to be ſeparated a little and placed at a certain diſtahce from the fibres of the <hi>Aorta,</hi> and the motional of the <hi>Viſcera's,</hi> leſt that the Blood perchance waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe more plentifully ſhould be ſometimes obſtructed, and ſo bring forth a Phlegmon, or a ſoon killing Impoſthume:<note place="margin">The uſe of the glandulous Coat.</note> Wherefore for the greater caution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch an accident, the glandulous Coat always coheres to the retiform fold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe Veſſels; to wit, for that end that the ſeroſities flowing over and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, both from the Nerves and from the Arteries, and not preſently carried back by the Veins, might be preſently received by thoſe numerous Glandula's, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they may be carried back to the Blood, (leſt they ſhould ruſh upon the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Fibres,<note place="margin">In the Artery the folding of the Veſſels is above the muſculary Coat, but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the <hi>Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cera.</hi>

For that Sleep oftentimes comes moderately and ſeaſonably it becomes of it ſelf a great Cardiack Remedy. But this paſſion is not always wont to be preſent, when nor as it ought to be, but ſometimes affects us evilly with its troubleſome preſence, ſometimes with its abſence.

This viciſſitude ſo long as it is rightly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, doth very much conduce both to the preſerving the health of the Body, and to the furniſhing of the gifts of the Mind: But if the dominion of either of them be too long continued, it will quickly be that there will not be long a whole mind in a whole Body. By immoderate ſleep, all the faculties both of the natural and animal Function, become very much ſtupified, and from hence one becomes more fit for the Grave than for Society. On the contrary, over great Waking de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys the ſtrength, and makes infirm or perverts the Animal powers: Wherefore among the Remedies accommodated to our needs, the moſt wiſe Creator hath ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undantly provided for theſe uſes, to wit, that it ſhould be in our power to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure or repel Sleep and Waking, as often as it ſhall ſeem convenient, and as often as they ſhall offend in exceſs, or in defect to moderate them: Which Medicines and by what means of working on the humane Body, they are wont to procure theſe deſired effects, it now lyes upon us to ſhew, and firſt we will ſpeak of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates or Remedies procuring Sleep.</p>

The reaſon of all theſe and the means of doing it we have already largely declared in another Tract: From which being truly weighed it will be juſt to think that the Particles of every kind of Opiate after it is taken being carried into the Blood, and circulated with it doth chiefly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe its narcotick or ſtupefying force neer the ſhell of the Brain; for they meet within this place the firſt forces of the animal ſpirits, and deſtroy or rather extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh wholly many of theſe placed in the fore part of the Battle; then, by reaſon that the other ſpirits of this Troop being made now thinner go back, and their

Elſewhere we have deſervedly aſſigned among the evident cauſes of this Affection the aggravation of the Stomach; for how often does any one, having eaten more groſs and undigeſted meats cauſing trouble and heavineſs of the Stomach become preſently ſleepy? The reaſon of which ſeems to be for that there is a great affinity between the ſpirits of the Stomach and thoſe inhabiting the Brain, and an intimate Sympathy betwixt them, ſo that the afflictions and evils of either of them do afflict the other (which indeed may very eaſily be ſhewn in many Inſtances) hence it eaſily comes to paſs that by reaſon of the ſpirits which preſide in the Ventricle being highly oppreſſed, and hindred from their free expanſion, and as it were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed, preſently the <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> of the whole Soul and eſpecially that principal part ſet before the Brain in like manner is ſtraitned contracts its Sayls and ſubmits its whole ſelf to the yoak of ſleep.<note place="margin">The reaſon of this unfolded.</note> How much the rather may it be thought when at any time the ſpirits of the Stomach imbibing the opiatick Juice are impoyſoned, and in a great abundance deſtroyed, that preſently all thoſe watching about the <gap reason="foreign">

The irregularities of the Motions to be rectifiied by Narcoticks are firſt a more vehement Pulſe, Convulſions of the <hi>Praecordia</hi> or <hi>Viſcera,</hi> and alſo the too violent and exceſſive excretions of theſe. So there are many and divers caſes in which whilſt the animal Spirits like fierce and furious Horſes run about, or leap beyond their bounds,<note place="margin">To either in a various reſpect.</note> they ought to be reduced or reſtrained by Opiates as it were with Bridles.

The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Difference of the propoſitions is, becauſe Pain being excited in one place is felt in another, and its effect is poured forth through the whole Soul. Its production conſiſts in this, that the nervous Fibres are irritated very much, and pulled one from another by ſome incongruous, and greatly unproportionate thing, ſo that the Spirits abounding in them are by and by diſtracted, and being ſnatched from their equal expanſion are agitated into Confuſion: but the ſenſe of Pain is effected for as much as that perturbation of the Spirits, by a certain undu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation through the nervous Paſſages to the common ſenſory, <hi>viz.</hi> chamfered, delated Bodies, doth ſtir up the Spirits there implanted into the like Diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: which ſort of Affection going forward even to the very middle of the Brain, moves the Imagination, and from thence being preſently reflected thorow the whole <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> of Spirits, diffuſes a certain trouble or inquietude. Therefore as this Pain is a Paſſion ſo largely extended and of ſo various a reſpect, it may well be ſearched into, what kind of Sphere of Activity Anodynes have.</p>
                        <p>Concerning theſe there is no cauſe of Doubt, but as often as ſleep is induced by <hi>Opium</hi> being firſt taken, a Ceſſation from Pain conſequently ſucceeds: then alſo this more immediate effect of it preſently follows; to wit, for as much as thoſe which actuate the firſt ſenſory are alſo bound with the Spirits inhabiting the Brain; and for that cauſe although the paining Part be irritated, the ſenſe of all Pain is inhibited: but indeed that when the patient awakes, and ſo remaining doth lively exerciſe all the animal Functions, continues free from Pain for many hours after the <hi>Opium</hi> is taken, and then the ſtrength of the Medicine bein ſpent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the ſame Tragedy returns, this Knot certainly deſerves to be looſed.</p>

In this condition I being at length ſent for to him, and finding him obſtinate for his foretaken Medicines, I made a Prognoſtick that he was not far from Death and that it was certainly to be expected, therefore he ſhould prepare himſelf and his affairs for Eternity. He not much diſturbed earneſtly asked that for his more eaſy dying, he might take our <hi>Laudanum,</hi> before but ſparingly permitted him, at his pleaſure or at leaſt in the Evening alſo: granting it with a certain admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, I left him and gave him as I thought the laſt farewel. Afterwards he took that Medicine dayly, and dayly increaſed its Doſe ſo that in a ſhort time he had taken an incredible quantity of it. By the uſe of this only Medicine he grew better every Day, and within a months ſpace was ſo well that being free from all Humours and Pains, he had got a Stomach and went abroad. By the aſſiduous uſe of this Opiate his Thirſt before much troubling him went away, and being every Night put into a great Sweat he alſo made plenty of Urine. I might here ſhew many cures of of other Diſeaſes eſteemed deplorable perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med only by the benefit of <hi>Opium;</hi> but this being ſomewhat beſides the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and tedious, I will only note in ſhort one or two more.</p>

                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Which and how many ways <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> is wont to hurt.</note>That the uſe of <hi>Opium</hi> hath been ſometimes thought hurtful and evil, we have ſeen by the ſad experience of ſome who have no ſooner taken it but they fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a perpetual ſleep, and of others who by reaſon of too great or untimely a Doſe of it have ſnatched away their Lives or elſe render it unhappy and unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table afterwards, by the hurt of the principal Faculties. Inſtances and Examples of this Nature are every where too frequently to be met with, made by Quackſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and Empiricks. I have known ſome who having taken a Pill of <hi>Laudanum</hi> to have fallen into ſo profound a ſleep that they could never be awakned: they have lived indeed three or four Days having their Pulſe, reſpiration and heat well enough, yet not to be recalled to Senſe and waking by any remedies or tortures. However I have obſerved from <hi>Opium</hi> taken by others that they have ſlept mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately only, yea ſometimes little or not at all, and preſently to be worſe as to their pulſe, reſpiration and heat: theſe indeed were wont to languiſh aſſoon as they had taken the Medicine, then to draw their Breath difficultly, and ſo grow worſe and worſe, nor could their ſtrength be reſtored to them by any Cordials but by
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:40331:88"/> degrees lingring they loſt their lives. I have ſomewhere received an Hiſtory of a certain robuſt man killed by <hi>Opium,</hi> who fell into no Sleep but the laſt and deadly, <hi>viz.</hi> Death it ſelf; he preſently upon taking the Medicine, complained of a great weight and coldneſs of his Ventricle, by and by he was affected with a notable <hi>languor</hi> and a ſinking down of all his Spirits, and a coldneſs of the extreme parts, and within four hours complaining that his eyes grew dim and then quite blind, he expired.</p>
                        <p>By this 'tis eaſily gathered that <hi>Opium</hi> does not always deſtroy Life by one and the ſame way, but has obtained at leaſt two chief ways of killing.<note place="margin">Its Poyſon affects firſt either the Brain or Cerebel.</note> The Reaſon of one of them conſiſts in this, that the Particles of the Medicine being taken, do firſt and rather affect the Brain; of the other, that they in like manner infeſt the Cerebel or little Brain. As to this latter the buſineſs is according to the following manner; if after the Medicine being taken, it happens by chance that the Orb of the Cerebel be ſo beſet by the narcotick little Bodies, that the outmoſt ſpirits being forthwith deſtroyed, the afflux of the interior towards the <hi>Praecordia</hi> is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed, and then by little and little cut off; there will be a neceſſity for the heart and the Organs of Reſpiration. firſt of all to flagg in the duties of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Function; and then wholly to ceaſe from labour: In the mean time as the ſick being free from an heavy <hi>torpor</hi> do awake, they are well enough in mind, and whilſt they live are perfect in Senſe. But if the opiatick Particles breaking in firſt of all, and with a full charge upon the border or Sphere of the Brain, and its inhabitants are ſtrongly invaded; in ſo muah that by and by the outmoſt Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits being profligated, alſo all the internal poſſeſſing its middle are greatly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, and leſt they may ſpring up again and recruit anew, their forces are altogether ſuppreſſed, then preſently a deep ſleep or an invincible and perpetual drowſineſs or ſtupefaction follows.

                        <p>Beſides theſe kind of deadly ſlaughters which <hi>Opium</hi> ſtill attempts upon humane Life, this Medicine hath obtained very many other ways of hurting, which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes becomes deſtructive to ſome private function or part of the Body. Since 'twill be tedious to rehearſe all the kinds of leſſer harms, which Narcoticks are wont to ſtir up,<note place="margin">It produces Evils in the Head, Breaſt, or Belly.</note> we will here only ſhew what evils do ſometimes happen from the improper or untimely uſe of it in the Head, what in the Breaſt, and alſo what in the Belly.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. As to the Firſt,<note place="margin">In the Head.</note> it is well enough known that the chief Functions of the Soul, <hi>viz.</hi> Memory, Diſcourſe, and ſharpneſs of Wit, are very often notably hurt by Narcoticks. The frequent uſe of them debilitates the memory in many men, I know one that loſt that faculty wholly by too great a doſe of <hi>Laudanum</hi> taken when in a Fever; then after ſome weeks; when the uſe of it begun to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, he could only remember what was done at a certain or peculiar time, and nothing of what was done before or after. I know ſome to have contracted a ſlowneſs or ſtupidity of wit, and others madneſs by this Medicine.<note place="margin">How <hi>Opium</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the Turks.</note> 
                           <hi>Hence (as</hi> Freitagius <hi>nortes) when</hi> Proſper Alpinus <hi>and</hi> Bellonius <hi>write, that the Egyptians and Turks are fed with</hi> Opium, <hi>for getting Boldneſs, Alacrity, and Appetite to</hi> Venus; <hi>they add however, that thoſe devourers of</hi> Opium <hi>although they ſeem to be well in health and not to be hurt with the uſe of it, yet that they are rendred more cold, and that their fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions were worſe, and that they appeared almoſt perpetually drunk and torpid, and were made full of Hair ſtupid and inconſtant, now affirming and now denying, ſo that people were afraid to meddle or converſe with them; that alſo it became a by-word, which they objected as a blot one to another: Go thou haſt eat</hi> Opium, <hi>which is no other than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, when they upbraid any one of Fudling or Drunkenneſs.</hi> Freitag. <hi>lib. de Opio Cap.</hi> 3. The Reaſon of theſe appears plain enough from what hath been already ſaid, <hi>viz. Opium</hi> produces the effects but now recited, for that it aſſaults firſt and chiefly the Brain, and whilſt it there deſtroys or profligates ſome animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, it perverts many others from their wonted ways of Emanations, and bends them into deuious or unuſuall tracts. But tht <hi>Opium</hi> is devoured in a great quantity by the Turks (I may add alſo ſome of our Countrymen having gotten by long Cuſtom, as it were, a certain defence or Armour of proof againſt its poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) unhurt, or at leaſt without any danger of life; the Reaſon is becauſe its Particles, although at firſt they are infeſtous and poyſonous to the Spirits, yet by the frequent uſe they at length become more congruous and familiar; even as
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:40331:89"/> we have obſerved concerning the taking of Tobacco in a Pipe, which when 'tis wont at firſt for a few days, to cauſe a <hi>Vertigo</hi> or dizzineſs, and oftentimes vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting or purging, yea a cold Sweat with a trembling, and frequent faintings; yet afterwards we take it without any diſturbance, yea at length with great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. But that a greater doſe of <hi>Opium</hi> ſhould add to them a boldneſs of Mind, ſo that they go to fight undauntedly and with notable confidence, the cauſe ſeems to be that that Medicine by ſtupefying ſomewhat the Spirits renders them aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, ſo that how terrible ſoever the things be that they meet with, to the Senſes they are unmoved. Laſtly, that it is aſſerted that Opiates provoke to Venery, when it ſhould rather ſeem they ſhould ſuppreſs that fury by their extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing the Spirits: We ſay (if that in truth it has that effect) that the genital humour and the Spirits abounding in it, do not deſcend from the Brain, but is poured forth immediately into the ſpermatick Veſſels, becauſe that for as much as Opiates do hinder or make leſs the <hi>geneſis</hi> of Spirits within the Brain, perhaps thy cauſe them to be more plentifully diverted to the genital mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>

That Opiates are ſometimes hurtful to the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and Breaſt, it plainly enough appears, becauſe they depreſs and diminiſh the Pulſe and Reſpiration; and ſometimes alſo (as we have ſhewed above) cauſe them to grow weak, and by degrees wholly to ceaſe: Wherefore in Fevers where the Blood being greatly depraved, ſeems to have no, or no good <hi>Craſis,</hi> and that it yields to the Animal Kingdom but very few, and weak Spirits only, Narcoticks are almoſt always hurtful, and as it were poyſons, for though in the Plague and in malignant Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, whilſt the Pulſe and Reſpiration are ſtrong; Mithridate, Treacle, and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſcordium,</hi> yea <hi>Laudanum</hi> are oftentimes given with ſucceſs: Yet if at any time in thoſe Diſeaſes, and in other Fevers not much malignant, the vital function lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes, theſe famous Antidotes are but very ſparingly, but more ſtrong Opiates not at all to be uſed. Moreover, in a moſt laborious Cough, Phthiſick, Pleuriſie, <hi>Empyema,</hi> and in other Diſeaſes of the Breaſt, in every one of them where Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſtirred up, ſuddenly ſo that caſting forth what is troubleſome and griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Breaſt, and urges it with its great endeavour, and alſo where the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of Reſpiration being deſtitute of great plenty of Spirits, grow weak, and perform their work difficultly and hardly, we muſt abſtain from <hi>Opium</hi> no leſs than from Poyſon; for in ſuch a caſe Narcoticks increaſe the weight to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and fix it, and leſſen the ſtrength of the parts which ought to remove them away.</p>

                              <hi>3.</hi> And what in the loweſt Belly.</note>3. We have above ſhewed that Opiates do operate within the <hi>Viſcera</hi> of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction and other parts of the lower Belly, and oftentimes in a various reſpect do bring notable helps, notwithſtanding they are not always ſo benign and friendly to this Region; but as it will be eaſily ſhewed they ſometimes cauſe a great evil. For truly Narcoticks being often taken, are very injurious ſometimes to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal faculty, <hi>viz.</hi> to the Appetite or deſire of Aliments, (on which depends all nouriſhment, and the Root of Life) for that they very much blunt it, and not rarely wholly deſtroy it: For when the Spirits inhabiting the interior Coat of the Ventricle, are ſtupefied or deſtroy by the Opiatick Particles, ſo that thoſe nervous Fibres although empty are no more corrugated, for which cauſe all hunger ceaſes, and food not at all deſired, but that being brought to the Stomach, becauſe being what is given is rather a trouble than delight; it is by and by ſpewed forth again. Moreover, for the ſame Reaſon the concocting force of the Ventricle is often debilitated, and the excretory motions both of this and of the Inteſtines, grow ſluggiſh: For 'tis a common obſervation, that the want of Appetite, and ſlothfulneſs of the Belly, are the familiar effects of an Opiatick Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine.</p>
                        <p>From theſe it will not be difficult to draw precepts and medicinal Cautions, about the right uſe of opiatick Pharmacy,<note place="margin">Phyſical Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about the uſe of <hi>Opium.</hi>

What the Conſtitution of the Patient may be. 2. What kind of Diſeaſe it is with which he labours. 3. In what ſtate the Animal Spirits are, in reſpect both of the Animal and Vital Function. 4.

                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. As to the Firſt, when an Hypnotick is required, ſee that the Temperament
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:40331:89"/> of the Sick, the habit of Body or Indiſpoſition, Cuſtom, kind of Life, do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the contrary. As for example, thoſe who are endued with a moderate ſtature, firm Body and well ſet, hot Blood, lively or quick Aſpect, do better bear this Medicine, and more often take it with benefit; which beſides they may much more ſecurely uſe, if they have been before accuſtomed to it. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it agrees much leſs, yea is ſometimes very hurtful to thoſe who are too fat or too lean, likewiſe to thoſe who being of a rare texture have Spirits eaſily diſſipable, or of a more cold temperament, have ſoft and flaccid Fleſh, and that are of themſelves ſleepy and dull, of a ſluggiſh and indocile nature: To which add alſo if that they never had experimented that Medicine before.</p>
                        <p n="2">2.<note place="margin">
                              <hi>2.</hi> In reſpect of the Diſeaſe.</note> The nature of the Diſeaſe is of great moment ſometimes for or contrary to Opiates. In more light affections to make uſe of it (according to <hi>Septalius</hi>) is the trick of a Phyſical Adulator: In the Palſie, <hi>Vertigo, Incubus,</hi> or Night-mare, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy, alſo in the <hi>Orthopnoea</hi> or ſtraitneſs of the Lights, in the Dropſie of the Breaſt or <hi>Abdomen,</hi> in the <hi>Stupor</hi> or trembling of the Members, in very malignant Fevers, and in the paroxyſms of intermitting Fevers, or in the <hi>Criſes</hi> of others, Narcoticks are moſt often interdicted. Beſides in the Cough with much ſpittle and thick in the <hi>Aſthma,</hi> and in all other thoracious Affections with an oppreſſion of the Lungs, and in the Hyſterick and other convulſive Paſſions, they are not to be given but rarely, and not without caution and counſel of a prudent Phyſician. But yet in cruel Headach, Catarrhs, Colicks, Pluriſie, ordinary Fevers, in Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting, Dyſentery, in Nephritick Paroxyſms, in Gouts and all kinds of Pains, the opiatick Pharmacy is not only allowed, but is ſought for as the only; and as it were divine <hi>Panacaea.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. But as often as this is propoſed or is deliberated on, we ought alſo to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider in what condition the Animal Spirits preſiding in each Dominion are:<note place="margin">
                              <hi>3.</hi> In reſpect of the animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</note> For if they are already few or oppreſſed, and do not enough expand themſelves they ought by no means to be any more leſſened or thrown down by Medicine: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whilſt that the Animal Faculties as to the ſenſe or diſcurſion are not very vigorous, or do not ſufficiently exert themſelves, or when the Pulſe and Reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion take the turns of their reciprocations but weakly, or are ſtopped or inequal or alſo more quick or ſlow than uſual, or laſtly, if a <hi>ſtupor</hi> or enervation with an unwonted languiſhment, poſſeſſes the members and motive parts, all kind of Hypnotick Pharmacy is to be avoided: But we doubt not to uſe the ſame, when at any time it is required by reaſon of ſome more grievous Diſeaſes, if that the Animal Spirits according to theſe and the other reſpects be robuſt enough, or are alſo too much expanſed or enlarged, or carried forth above meaſure or become fierce or unruly.</p>
                        <p n="4">4.<note place="margin">
                              <hi>4.</hi> In reſpect of the Blood and Humours.</note> But in the mean time the Condition of the Blood and humours is not to be neglected, becauſe ſometimes the wicked and naughty condition of theſe does altogether forbid Opiates, or permit them to be taken but ſparingly, and with a certain reſtriction: The Blood forbids the uſe of them when it offends either in quantity or quality, or in its <hi>Craſis</hi> or Diſpoſition. As to the former, the bloody <hi>Latex</hi> either ſuperabounds or is deficient; in either reſpect it excludes Narcotick Pharmacy: For in the firſt place, whenſoever the Blood is turging with plenty, and boyling up as in a Fever, it hugely diſtends the Veſſels, and ſo the <hi>Praecordia</hi> do highly labour to drive it about moſt quickly, with ſwiftly repeated turns of <hi>Syſtoles,</hi> leſt it ſhould any where ſtagnate or flow over; then certainly to give a Narcotick, whereby that labour and endeavour of the Heart moſt neceſſary for the preſervation of Life ſhould be hindred; would be the part rather of a poyſoner than of a Phyſician. Wherefore in the <hi>Plethora</hi> or overcharge of Blood, Phlebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy ought to be uſed inſtead of Opiates. In the ſecond place, no leſs evil pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from Narcoticks, as often as in the defect or want of Blood; as after great hemorrhages, long faſtings, or continual ſickneſſes they are adminiſtred, becauſe, when the flood or the Blood is very ſmall, and by reaſon of its exiguity hardly continued, leſt that its <hi>fluor</hi> ſhould be broken off and ſo ceaſe; the Heart ſtrives for or endeavours its quick circumagitation, working with a very nimble Pulſe, as it were, with double endeavours. From hence it is plain to conceive what hurt Opiates will cauſe, which put a <hi>remora</hi> or ſtop to this endeavour of the Heart then ſo highly neceſſary. Indeed for this Reaſon it ſeems to be that we interdict Sleep to women preſently after the Birth of the Child, whilſt the <hi>Lochia</hi> are flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:40331:90"/> down, and to others in a free miſſion of Blood or immenſe Hemorrhage, <hi>viz.</hi> leſt the Spirits in the time of Sleep being called back, ſhould leave the Heart with which it ſwiftly drives about the diminiſhed River of the Blood. Further, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Blood offending in quality, or (as I may more properly ſpeak) in its <hi>Craſis,</hi> forbids the uſe of Opiates; becauſe whilſt in a <hi>Cacochymia</hi> or Fever, the Blood being very much ſtuffed with recrements or ſuperfluities, ought to be agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated and more ſwiftly circulated by a greater labour of the Heart, to wit, that the heterogeneous Particles might be overcome and quickly evaporated; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of a Narcotick coming between doth ſtop this endeavour of the <hi>Praecor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> and ſo retards, and ſometimes fruſtrates the luſtration or circulation of the Blood.</p>
                        <p>As to what reſpects the other recrementitious humours, that are wont to be accumulated within the Ventricle or Inteſtines, theſe alſo ought to be carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, or purged forth by Vomit or Stool before an Opiate be adminiſtred; for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe being fixed there they will ſtick more pertinaciouſly. Becauſe the ſplanch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Fibres being ſtupefied by the Medicine are not irritated as before; neither eaſily go about or lively perform the excretory Convulſions for the expelling thoſe ſuperfluities: Wherefore according to the old Precept, if that there be any thing to be evacuated, let it be evacuated before the Narcotick Pharmacy or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuation.</p>

But yet there are other Medicines of this kind preſcribed, which not by ſtupefying or deſtroying the angry Spirits, but by ſtroking and ſoftening them, gently draw and compoſe them to Reſt.</p>

                           <note place="margin">A rehearſal of Narcoticks.</note>1. They are wont to refer to the former Claſs of theſe (which may only be properly called Opiates or Narcoticks) Poppy both the white and the wild, Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane, Hounds or Dogs tongue, Mandrakes, Nightſhade, and certain others more venomous; and ſo never to be medicinally preſcribed: But the Roots, Leaves, Flowers, Seeds, and the thickned Juices of ſome of theſe not ſo unwholeſome are made uſe of, and (as we have above-ſhown) are often taken with great ſucceſs. But truly ſince each of theſe have ſomething of poyſon mixed with them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are not indifferently to be preſcribed, now theſe now thoſe, as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Phyſical Medicines, but only to make uſe of thoſe which are approved of by a ſafe and long experience.<note place="margin">White Poppy.</note> Hence at length Cuſtom (from which it is not ſafe to recede without danger to humane Life) hath obtained that Poppy and prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it, are the <hi>Baſis</hi> or Complement of almoſt the whole opiatick <hi>Pharmaceu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,</hi> the ſeeds of Henbain, and the Roots and Juice of Hounds Tongue, are put into the compoſitions of ſome Hypnoticks; notwithſtanding as often as we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:40331:90"/> thorowly and alſo ſafely to provoke Sleep, the whole force of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine is placed in <hi>Opium</hi> or <hi>Diacodium.</hi> There will be no need here to deſcribe the white Poppy, out of which theſe are made, nor to ſhew the extraction of the opiatick Juice, or the compoſition of that Syrup, ſince that they are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently enough declared in the Botanick and Antidotary Books both of the Ancients and Moderns. But what remains for us to do and which is more to our purpoſe, is that we now endeavour to expound the elementary parts of <hi>Opium,</hi> and from thence to ſearch out the vertues both of the <hi>Diacodium,</hi> and the means of their intoxicating.</p>
                        <p>The body of <hi>Opium</hi> may as to its conſtitutive parts be better known,<note place="margin">The nature and parts of <hi>Opium.</hi>
                           </note> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined whole and untouched, than reſolved ſpagyrically: becauſe if it be diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by fire by reaſon of plenty of impure Sulphur it contracts an horrible <hi>Empereu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> or fiery taſt, and diffuſes a very hurtful ſtink. But yet it is obvious to the ſenſe that ſulphureous Particles do abound in this concrete, which alſo its moſt filthy <hi>Odor,</hi> and its inflammability manifeſtly declare: and although it is equally certain that ſaline Particles are adjoyned to the Sulphur, and ſo this concrete doth chiefly conſiſt of theſe two together with a little Earth, yet of what nature and in what ſtate that Salt ſhould be, cannot be defined; but ſo much we may be able to affirm from the effects that this ſulphureous ſaline Concretion is altogether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and deſtructive to the Texture of the animal Spirits, which is ſpiritual and ſaline volatile.<note place="margin">In what the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cotick force con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts.</note> And indeed it may be gathered from very many inſtances that narcotick force lies hid in the Sulphur with the aculeated Salt (from whence it acquires ſo ſtinking a ſmell) for of this nature are the white Poppy, Mandrake, Henbane, Tobacco, and other Opiates, all which have almoſt alike ſtinking ſmell, and in the ſmelling to them very ungrateful to our Spirits. Moreover becauſe the animal Spirits may be ſomewhat of a divers Texture in various Bodies, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Opiates may work more ſtrongly and virulently on ſome than others. The Turks and Egyptians, in whom from an aduſt blood,<note place="margin">It doth not ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate after a like manner in all.</note> more fixed Spirits and leſs volatile are procured, eat <hi>Opium</hi> without hurt or at leaſt without danger of Life, the Europians not ſo, who have more ſubtle and purer Spirits. Dogs devour <hi>Opium</hi> in a great quantity without any ſleepineſs or death. A little doſe of it preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kils a Cat, for that the ſpirits of this beaſt, ſo very ſaline volatile cannot at all endure the narcotick Sulphur. And hence it is that one grain of the oyl of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco being laid upon the tongue of this Animal preſently excites Convulſions and Stupor, to which forthwith death follows.<note place="margin">It hurts not a Dog ſo as it does a Cat or a Man.</note> Once I ſaw given to an ordinary Dog ſops of Bread rolled in <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ij of <hi>Opium:</hi> after which growing very ſick he became torpid or rather ſtupid, and drawing his Breath difficultly and laboriouſly ſeemed as if he was about to dye, but then within half an hour he eaſed his belly plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with the moſt horrid and troubleſome ſtink that ever I ſmelt in my life, and preſently thereupon he became well and lively. But that ſuch a quantity of <hi>Opium</hi> did the leſs hurt to this Animal, perhaps the cauſe may in part be the notably acid ferment of his Ventricle, by which the Particles of the narcotick Sulphur might be ſomewhat broken and overcome; and ſo by reaſon of this Sulphur being very much diſſolved by the acid <hi>Menſtruum</hi> of the Stomach, the highly ſtinking de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the Belly proceeded.<note place="margin">Some Inſtance<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

In like manner alſo when the ſpirits of Vinegar is mixed with an Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial <hi>Lixivium.</hi> I might take notice of many others of this kind. But indeed 'tis not to be denied that the Particles of <hi>Opium</hi> do work on the dogs ſpirits which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding do more ſtrongly reſiſt the narcotick Venom than the ſpirits of a Man, or of other Beaſts, as it is clear by the Hiſtory but now mentioned; for as much as when the torpor and difficult and diſturbed Reſpiration by reaſon of the ſpirits inhabiting the <hi>Encephalon</hi> being affected by the narcotick began to ariſe, thoſe ſymtoms aſſoon as the narcotick matter was overcome by purging preſently vaniſhed. Beſides I have known the truth of this opinion confirmed more by an anatomical experiment. Many years ago we ſaw about three ounces of the tincture of <hi>Opium</hi> done in Canary tranfuſed into the Jugulary Vein of a little Dog, the vein being cloſed the dog ran about after his wonted manner and ſeemed little or nothing affected or changed; after a quarter of an hour he began to be a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſtupefied, to nod his head, and at length began to fall into a Sleep, but not
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:40331:91"/> permitting him when we had hindred him a while by beating, terrifying, and courſing him about, at length the ſoporous Affection being ſo done away he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came whole and lively enough: as it appears from hence, the opiatick Poyſon is ſo overcome either within the <hi>Viſcera</hi> of concoction by their ferments, or elſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by the animal ſpirits themſelves, as that it is not always, nor alike in all, either an Hypnotick or deadly.</p>
                        <p>As to what reſpects the top of the white Poppy with the ſeeds, of which <hi>Did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codium,</hi> Decoctions, Emulſions, and other hypnotick Confections are made, it planely appears that theſe are far leſs indued with narcotick Sulphur then the concrete juice of <hi>Opium;</hi> and what of it is in them is much more pure and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. Wherefore we oftner and more ſecurely give Remedies compoſed of this: For it is not fit to make uſe of <hi>Laudanum</hi> unleſs when for the vehemency of Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms Diacodiates will do little good.<note place="margin">Diacodiates.</note> Further as theſe contain in themſelves leſs of virulency, they want not much preparation but being ſimply made by decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Infuſion, or expreſſion, they may be brought into medical uſe: but <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> is ſeldom ſo ſimple and preſcribed by it ſelf, but is wont to be corrected and compoſed after a various and divers preparation, whereby it may become a ſafe Anodyne.</p>

                           </note>The preparation of <hi>Opium</hi> is either ſimple or with diſſolvers and correctors joyned with it. The way of the former conſiſts almoſt only in this, that its Maſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſliced into little flakes is ſo long expoſed to the heat of the Fire or the Sun until the narcotick Sulphur being in part evaporated, the reſt becomes friable and leſs ſtinking: which kind of preparation is wont to be firſt made before others. For whether we would endeavour to get the Tincture, Extract or Confection of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium,</hi> firſt this previous operation is dryed and reduced into a powder. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over hither ought to be referred its fumigation with Sulphur by the ſame means as we cure Scammony: becauſe the acid vapour aſcending from the common Sulphur whilſt it burns, overcomes or breaks very much the virulency of either of them both of the narcotick and cathartick Sulphur.</p>

                           <note place="margin">The Opiates of the Ancients re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated.</note>The preparations of <hi>Opium</hi> with adjuncts or rather its Compoſitions, are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and many; of which ſome were more famous and noted among the Ancients, others among thoſe of latter days. The Opiates of the Ancients chiefly noted are Pills of Dogs Tongue, the <hi>Requies</hi> of <hi>Nicolaus,</hi> and <hi>Philonium,</hi> of the laſt of which there were four, <hi>viz.</hi> Roman, Perſian, (the uſe of which is yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what retained) and the <hi>Philonium</hi> of <hi>Galen</hi> and of <hi>Meſue.</hi>

                        <p>The deſcriptions of all theſe are ſeen commonly in every Antidotary, ſo that there is no need to repeat them here. The reaſon of the Compoſitions of theſe chief Anodynes, although built upon an erroneous foundation, as to the other reſpects is underſtood well enough. For that out of a falſe ſuppoſition that <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium</hi> being cold in the fourth degree moſt of what they received into their <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniums</hi> being hot in the ſame degree, <hi>viz.</hi> Wild Pellitory, <hi>Euphorbium,</hi> white Pepper, and others are added, of the like nature, which truly are not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly correctors of <hi>Opium.</hi> But yet not as if it were their Heat oppoſes the frigidity or coldneſs of that (becauſe indeed it is not cold but rarher hot) but theſe ſharp biting things being full of volatile Salt, do predominate over the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cotick Sulphur of the <hi>Opium,</hi> and break its virulency.</p>

                           <hi>that there were a company of falſe Phyſicians ariſen, who for the moſt uſual Pills of Dogs Tongue, gave an opiate Confection called by them</hi> Lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, <hi>with which they promiſed not only to reſtore ſleep, but alſo to drive away all Diſeaſes. So much</hi> (ſays he) <hi>has the</hi> Encomium <hi>of this Medicine prevailed with theſe runagates that there is no Empirick, none ſo dull medicaſter or not ſo common a Barter who does not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs himſelf a Laudaniſt. Without doubt this cuſtom however evil and moſt pernicious to humane Life is not yet worn out.</hi> For that alſo among our Countrymen there is not only a company but a ſwarm rather of falſe Chymiſts and Quackſalvers; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of which boaſts of his peculiar <hi>Laudanum,</hi> which they raſhly give in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Diſeaſe and Condition, and if by chance it happens for the ſick to ſleep and wake again, preſently they ſing and are Cock a hoop, when rather they merit the gallows, for that the Pulſe and Reſpiration being overthrown by reaſon
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:40331:91"/> of their unſeaſonably giving an Opiate, oftentimes all hopes of the <hi>Criſis</hi> and of the cure is fruſtrated: wherefore it behoves you to be warned whoever hath any regard to his Life, that you diligently beware of theſe unskilful Laudaniſts.</p>
                        <p>Not only the uſe of Opiates but much more the Invention and preparation of them are to be prohibited to Empiricks, and Quackſalvers: For indeed it is the work of a prudent and learned Phyſitian, ſo to temper their Venoms as that they may not be poyſon, but Antidote. Wherefore <hi>Laudana</hi>'s are not to be admitted into practice unleſs ſuch as are invented by skilful men and long made tryal of; of which ſort there are many extant publickly received and approved of, ſo that there is no need of new ones daily to be deviſed.<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Laudana</hi> in form of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract.</note> The more Ancient <hi>Laudana</hi>'s of <hi>Paraſelſus, Crollius, Quercetan, Hartman,</hi> and other famous Chymiſts by them related and deſcribed in many <hi>Pharmacopoeas</hi> are compoſed only in the form of an extract; in all which the Tincture of <hi>Opium</hi> drawn forth with a ſit <hi>Menſtruum</hi> is the <hi>Baſis</hi> or ground; to which tincture others are added, <hi>viz.</hi> of Saffron, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, (which <hi>Guianerus</hi> names the <hi>Bezoar</hi> of <hi>Opium) Species Diambrae,</hi> and ſuch like; and ſo all being confuſed together are diſtilled in <hi>Balneo,</hi> that the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> being drawn off, the remainder may be reduced to the conſiſtency of Hony, in the finiſhing of which laſtly Pearls, precious Powders, Chymical Oyls, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things eſteemed Cardiacks are added: The Medicine being ſo made up is given for the moſt part in form of a Pill,</p>
                        <p>Although theſe ſort of <hi>Laudana</hi>'s are efficacious enough and ſeem to be elegant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compoſed,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Liquid</hi> Lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's.</note> yet the Neotericks ſomewhat varying the form make their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence (whereby they may be the better taken in any Liquor) liquid; and alſo for that when any opiatick Pill (not more noted for its benefits than for its Harms) may be a terror to ſome, a doſe of liquid <hi>Laudanum</hi> (if perhaps it ſeems neceſſary the patient refuſing it) may be better hid, and being poured into other liquor may paſs rather for a Cordial than an Hypnotick. And indeed concerning the uſe of Opiates the ſick are ſometimes too much and ſometimes too little cautious, and ſo as they are in one caſe to be warned, ſo in the other they ought to be drawn to it and deceived. For the making the liquid <hi>Laudanum</hi> in like manner as the ſolid the Tinctures of the <hi>Opium</hi> and the adjuncts are extracted one from another al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt after the ſame way; which being all confuſed and the <hi>Menſtruums</hi> drawn off to the middle, there will remain a Medicine ſplendidly red or bluſhing whoſe doſe is wont to be from ℈ſs to ℈j.</p>
                        <p>Concerning theſe two kinds of <hi>Laudana</hi>'s,<note place="margin">What <hi>Menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> is moſt fit for the making the <hi>Laudanum.</hi>
                           </note> it is a great matter with what kinds of <hi>Menſtruum</hi> the Tincture of the <hi>Opium</hi> is extracted; ſo that the buſineſs has cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed great contention among ſome Chymiſts of no ſmall note; whilſt they ſuppoſing it cold uſe the ſpirit of Wine, others on the contrary to bridle the heat of <hi>Opium,</hi> diſſolve it in the ſpirit of Vinegar or in the juice of Citrons: Indeed either <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum</hi> is ſufficient and are almoſt both alike, ſo it be reduced into an extract; but if in a liquid form there can be no ſolutive of <hi>Opium</hi> better to be met with than the ſpirit of Wine impregnated with the volatiliſed Salt of Tartar. For this moſt readily diſſolves its Maſs, receives a tincture like to a reſplendent Ruby; more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over ſomewhat brings under the narcotick Sulphur and takes away its evil ſmell: Indeed the ſalt of Tartar is the beſt corrector of <hi>Opium,</hi> or rather its Antidote. Hence the opiatick Pill of a certain empirick, in which the diſſolvent of the <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> is ſalt of Tartar imbued with the oyl of Turpentine, hath been accounted of no contemptible uſe, there is added to that Compoſition the powder of white Hellebore; but that only as I ſuppoſe they may aſſert ſome Parodoxes, that tamed poyſons become the moſt precious Medicines.</p>
                        <p>Of late years the uſe of a certain liquid <hi>Laudanum</hi> the Author of which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſaid to be <hi>Helmont,</hi> hath grown famous:<note place="margin">The <hi>Laudanum</hi> called Helmon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian.</note> it hath for its <hi>Menſtruum</hi> the juice of Quinces put into a fermentation with Yeſt or Barm of Ale or Beer; when this has extracted the Tincture of <hi>Opium</hi> being dyed with a deep yellow, which being ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and aromatiſed, and drawn off to the half in <hi>Balneo;</hi> then the remaining part is reſerved for uſe, and is this liquid <hi>Laudanum,</hi> whoſe doſe is from <hi>gut.</hi> 15 to 20. The other part by a further diſtillation is reduced into a pilulary form and is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from <hi>gr.</hi> j to ij. That liquid <hi>Opium</hi> I have often given with an happy ſucceſs in dyſenterick Affections: But our liquid <hi>Laudanum</hi> (which we do more often uſe) hath for its <hi>Menſtruuw</hi> the tincture of the ſalt of Tartar brought to the higheſt red by long digeſtion; and as the Tincture of <hi>Opium</hi> extracted by this, is the ground
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:40331:92"/> of the Medicine, we add for its complement Saffron, <hi>Caſtor,</hi> Cloves, and <hi>Lignum Aloes,</hi> the doſe from 15 to 25 props.</p>

Of this may be had in the Apothecaries ſhop the Syrup and the diſtilled Water, which are often given with great benefit in moſt continual Fevers; and are thought to help in the Pleuriſy with a certain ſpecifick force; becauſe truly they take away pains, and by ſtopping ſomewhat the Pulſe depreſs the feveriſh aeſtuation of the Blood. Further, a tincture is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the flowers of this infuſed in the ſpirit of Wine, which is a famous Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine among the Empiricks and good Women, and eſteemed very good againſt a Surfet. The reaſon of whoſe help ſeems to be, that the ſpirits of the Wine deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the contents of the Stomach from putrefaction, and the narcotick virtue of the Flowers provides againſt the aſſaulting Fevers.</p>

                           <note place="margin">Tobacco.</note>Tobacco by right challenges a place among them and brings up the rear of Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coticks; for although it is not put into their compoſitions, yet its fume being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in a pipe oftentimes produces the ſame effects as they: yea, not only cauſes ſleep it ſelf but ſometimes its contrary, waking. I ſhall not go about to deſcribe the origin or manner of this cuſtom commonly known to every one of every Sex, Age, and Condition, Indeed why I rank it with Opiates is becauſe it doth almoſt the ſame thing with our Countrymen as <hi>Opium</hi> with the Turks: to wit, either of them by affecting the animal Spirits after an unaccuſtomed manner, and by rendring them as it were aſtoniſhed, diſpoſes them to the doing or ſuffering of any thing without any great ſenſe of trouble or wearineſs.<note place="margin">The effect of the taking this.</note> Wherefore virtues and effects not only manifold but diverſe, yea (as I hinted but now) contrary and repugnant one to another are aſcribed to the ſmoak of Tobacco taken at the mouth after the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar way. For it is ordinary ſaid to warm us when chill and cold, alſo to refrige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate thoſe that are hot, to cauſe or to drive away ſleep, in like manner to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh or to excite hunger and thirſt: the reaſon of all which conſiſts in this, that the animal ſpirits being gently agitated by this <hi>Enthymiama</hi> or inflamed ſmoak, and as it were provoked into certain dances, they are wholly deaf to the approaches of any troubleſome thing; yea whatſoever is hard to be perfomed by them, or to be ſuffer'd, they do being almoſt inſenſible and undiſturb'd: wherefore the uſe of Tobacco (when it may be had) ſeems not only neceſſary but profitable for Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Mariners; for that it renders them both fearleſs of any dangers, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of Hunger,<note place="margin">The reaſons.</note> Cold, and Labour. But truly it appears from hence that this greatly narcotick fume is very infeſtous to the ſpirits (before by frequent cuſtom it becomes familiar to them) becauſe there is none almoſt who at the firſt taking and uſe of it but ſuffers great perturbations in his Brain and nervous Stock. For when at any time one is initiated into this dry potation, preſently as if he were drunk he is affected with a <hi>Vertigo</hi> and <hi>Scotomia</hi> or dizineſs in the head, then a cruel vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting and ſometimes purging follows, the feet grow weak or ſtagger, the hands tremble, the tongue faulters, or ſpeaks at random. Oftentimes alſo a cold ſweat and terrible ſwoonings follow; the cauſe of all which is, that the animal Spirits
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:40331:92"/> being as it were intoxicated by the narcotick Sulphur, are diſtracted very much in their whole dominion, and are agitated into <hi>Ataxias</hi> or irregularities; not only the firſt and ſecond time, but oftentimes, tis for a very long while after their firſt taking it before they can be able to take the fume of Tobacco without great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of the ſpirits. But aſſoon as this cuſtome becomes familiar and cuſtomary; 'tis grateful, and takes the animal Spirits with ſo great a witchcraft or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing allurements, that ſome had rather be interdicted meat or drink than the uſe of it. The reaſon of which is that this ſmoaking gently awaking or ſtirring up the animal Spirits at any time ſluggiſh and ſloathful, and as it were tickling them, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes them into gentle and expanſive motions, with which they are wonderfully recreated as with the drinking of Wine.</p>
                        <p>So much for the chief Narcoticks, and their preparations, and manner of u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of them, all which belong to the ſtock of Vegetables: but that minerals may not be thought to effect nothing, there are ſome who boaſt they have prepared out of their more hard concretes moſt excellent Opiates altogether without <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um. Quercetan</hi> preſcribes a certain <hi>Nepenthe</hi> to be made out of the narcotick Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur of Vitriol and from the oyl of the Sun and Moon (or of Gold and Silver) with the tincture of Corals and of other famous Cordials, highly efficacious for the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away of all pains and languors: The virtues of which Medicine I am ſo far from admiring that I rather think there is no ſuch Sulphur and metallick Oyls, or that in truth there can be little or nothing gotten: Therefore returning to the real and genuine Narcoticks, we will as a complement to the work ſet down ſome of their ſelect forms; which we will digeſt into certain Claſſes according as the Opiates have for their <hi>Baſis</hi> either the Syrup or diſtilled Water of wild Poppy, or <hi>Diacodium</hi> or <hi>Laudanum</hi> extract or liquid or Pills of <hi>Styrax</hi> or of Cynogloſs or laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Philonium.</hi>

                        <p>But as we have fully diſcourſed hitherto of Opiates, and of their preparations and ways of operating: according to our former method now ſhould follow to be handled, the contrary Medicines to theſe, or Antihypnoticks, <hi>viz.</hi> which by dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving away ſleep too much troubleſome do render us wakeful; had I not fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed this task formerly in the Pathology of the Brain (where we have treated of the Lethargy and other ſoporiferous Affections and their Remedies) ſo that there is no need to repeat here the ſame again.<note place="margin">Coffee drink.</note> But ſince that both there and in other places hath been made by us frequent mention of a certain Liquor called Coffee, highly efficacious for the driving away the <hi>Narcoſis</hi> or ſtupefyingneſs; it ſeems not to be altogether from the purpoſe to ſpeak here a little more (than we have elſe where hinted) concerning this Drink and the effects of it, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of its acting. It will be from the purpoſe to diſcourſe of its Antiquity, and of its common uſe now among the Turks, and formerly among the Arabians and other Eaſtern People: but that this Drink alſo of late years is brought into cuſtom by our own Countrymen, and that there is almoſt none but underſtands well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough by experience its efficacy and virtue for the driving away of ſleep, we will therefore inquire into the reaſons of this ſo well known and experienced Effect.<note place="margin">Its effect.</note> We have ſaid (in the Chapter of Waking) that the reaſon of it conſiſts in this, that this Drink inſinuates aduſt Particles (which we may find both by our taſte and ſmell that it abounds with) into the blood; and from thence into the nervous Juice, which for that cauſe both by their incongruity and their mobility or unquietneſs, detain the Pores of the exterior Brain continually open, and by ſome other way of fettering them add to the Spirits, laying aſide their <hi>torpor</hi> or drowſineſs, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain furies and provokings by which they are excited to the longer performing of their duties: For indeed to the inducing of ſleep theſe two things are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, one or the other of which is ſtill firſt or rather for the effecting it. To wit, it behoves the Pores and all the paſſages of the exterior brain or its <hi>Cortex</hi> or ſhell to be ſtuffed very much and filled full, and ſo to be ſhut up by the Liquor, there as it were ſtilled forth and overflowing from the Blood;<note place="margin">Its Aetielogy delivered.</note> then beſides for the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of this effect there is need that the animal Spirits excluded from the Pores, and thoſe paſſages, and beſides oftentimes burthened with nutritious and ſerous Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, being given to Idleneſs, ſhould betake themſelves to the middle of the Brain. Concerning this task requiſite to ſleep there is not ſtill one and the ſame order. For ſometimes the animal Spirits firſt and of their own accord relinquiſh thoſe ſpaces the nervous juice by and by ruſhing into the ſame voyd places; but ſometimes the nervous Humour with the ſerous being more plentifully poured in, the firſt invades thoſe paſſages driving their ſpirits thence againſt their wills and compelling them inwardly.</p>
                        <p>But the operation of Coffee ſeems contrary to both effects. The aduſt Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles highly active and ready being delated into the Blood not preſently after the drinking it, do ſomewhat fuſe its Liquor, the ſerous water being detruded towards
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:40331:93"/> the Reins and habit of the Body; further they driving towards the brain eaſily o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen its Pores which they detain very open with their mobility; then they grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Spirits do uncloath them from all other Particles both gravative or nutritious, and ſo ſtir them up on every ſide being light and nimble and make them to be ſtretched abroad thorow the whole compaſs of the Brain freed from any hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy oppletion and obſtruction.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time notwithſtanding,<note place="margin">Its benefits and imcommodities noted.</note> whilſt the Spirits being continually and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weariedly exerciſed after this manner, are deprived of the acceſs and aſſimilati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the nervous juice, plenty of them are not ſufficiently renewed after the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted manner. Indeed the old veterane Spirits are rendred more agil and nimble, but the ſupplies of the new ones are diminiſhed. Hence as it eaſily appears that this drink though moſt commonly uſed, and very profitable in ſome caſes, and very medicinal; is to others perhaps very hurtful, or leſs healthful, Indeed that it is ſo, not only reaſon but alſo common obſervation every where dictitates, for as much as the great drinkers of Coffee become lean, and oftentimes paralytick and obnoxious to an impotency to <hi>Venus.</hi> The firſt effect is ſo frequently and every where known, that I have for that reaſon only forbid many the drinking of Coffee becauſe it diſpoſes to leanneſs,</p>
                        <p>For that as the Blood by the exceſſive and continual uſe of it is made more ſharp and torrid, it therefore becomes leſs able for nouriſhment.<note place="margin">It makes people lean.</note> But as to the Affects of the Brain or nervous Stock, I do frequently preſcribe this drink ſooner than any thing elſe for their cure, and therefore am wont to ſend the ſick to the Coffee houſes ſooner than to the Apothecaries ſhops.</p>
                        <p>Indeed in very many cephalick Diſeaſes and Sickneſſe, <hi>viz.</hi> great Headaches,<note place="margin">It diſpoſes to the Palſy.</note> 
                           <hi>Vertigo,</hi> Lethargy, Catarrhs and ſuch like, where there is with a full habit of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and cold or leſs hot temperament and wateriſh blood, an humid brain, but a <hi>torpor</hi> and ſlothfulneſs of the animal Spirits, the drinking of Coffee is often taken with great benefit, for continually drinking it wonderfully clears and illuſtrates either part of the Soul, and diſpels all the clouds of each function: but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, who are lean and of a bilous or melancholy Temperament or have a ſharp blood or torrid, a hot brain or animal Spirits too much ſtirred up and unquiet, ought to abſtain wholly from this drink; for that it rather perverts both the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and humours and renders them alſo weak and altogether unable for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming their functions. For I have obſerved many not indued with plenty enough of ſpirits, and obnoxious to the Headach, <hi>Vertigo,</hi> the Palpitation of the Heart, the trembling or numneſs of the joynts, to have become worſe preſently upon the drinking of Coffee, and ſuddenly to have felt an unwonted <hi>languor</hi> in their whole Body.</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
                  <p>SInce firſt I began to conſider the Operations of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines in humane Bodies, and their manner of working, and for ſome time meditating upon the entire Subject, at length publiſhed an Eſſay of the Rational Cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory part; I became affected with ſo vehement a deſire of farther proſecuting that Speculation, that in all ſpare hours, (to wit as frequently as I might be vacant from my practice) I could hardly intend or admit thoughts of any other thing: And that not ſo much that I might pleaſe others, as by often turning in my mind, and writing my Meditations of this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, I might be better inſtructed to preſcribe to my Patients. For certainly the not duely weighing the Reaſons by which Medicines operate, renders all Phyſick to be Empirical, and to be governed rather by Chance or Fortune than by Advice; and it frequently comes to paſs, that a Medicine raſhly admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, is but caſting a Die for a mans Life. Wherefore, that I might ſatisfie my ſelf, and practiſe Phyſick (as is uſually ſaid) with a ſafe Conſcience, it pleaſed me to beſtow more labour in the ſearch of the true Reaſons of phyſical Energies and Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacies. And becauſe in this Treatiſe, we chiefly conſider Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, reſpecting certain private parts or Regions of the body, and their proper Diſeaſes, therefore we have endeavoured in the firſt place to perform theſe three things; <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt that a moſt accurate Anatomical Deſcription might be given of the parts, (if not already extant) whoſe diſtempers and remedies are treated of, as to the Fabrick and uſes of all their Veſſels. Wherefore, turning over the Breaſt and Lungs, and moſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently viewing their inward receſſes and apartments, what thing ſoever obſervable either the Ancients or Moderns have
<pb facs="tcp:40331:104"/> publiſhed about theſe, and whatſoever further by Knife or Microſcope we have detected, we have here ſet forth. In which task, as formerly in ſome others of the ſame nature more exactly done, I muſt confeſs I owe much to the ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous labour of my moſt learned Friend Dr. <hi>Edmund King,</hi> and to his moſt dexterous Diſſections. And really I eſteem it ſo neceſſary to lay the Hiſtory of the parts, as a foundation to our Rational Curatory Method, that without it I did believe the whole Superſtructure would be meerly phantaſtical and altogether unſtable, or at leaſt unprofitable. For ſurely, either to practiſe Phyſick, or demonſtrate its Operations on humane Bodies, without an exact knowledge of the parts and paſſages, on which, and by which they work, would ſeem equally abſurd, as if a Philoſopher ignorant of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical affairs, ſhould go about to unfold and explicate the Artifice and cunning Workmanſhip of a Clock moving of it ſelf, according to the Theory of Natural Motion deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> Wherefore we have view'd with moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act diligence, in the firſt place, the Subjects of Phyſick, or the places of Operation in our Bodies, as the Circuit in which we are to move. Then ſecondly we have not been leſs ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous, that according to the Phaenomena of all parts lately detected by Anatomical obſervation, the true and real Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſes of Diſeaſes ſhould be built, whereof we have deſigned the Remedies; that not ſtill perſiſting in the thread-bare paths of Ancient Phyſick, by a certain blind and implicite obſequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, after the manner of Beaſts, according to the proverb, to be only guided by our Anceſtors footſteps; but deriving the Cauſes and formal Reaſons of Diſeaſes from their very Springs, we every where endeavour to ſhew, from what Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Blood and Humours, from what affection of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits, from what habitude of Fibres, and of other ſolid parts, every diſeaſe proceeds. And theſe things ſo premiſed, and laid inſtead of a ſolid Foundation, at length in the third place, that the ſtructure of our Curatory method being rightly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted, may happily riſe up and firmly conſiſt, we have ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together moſt of the Medicines reſpecting moſt of the private parts and regions of the body, and the peculiar Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> both Simple and Compound, both Old and New, both Dogmatical and Empirical, gathered out of the Phyſick-books of every Age, as alſo thoſe chiefly celebrated by Quacks and Nurſes; more choice forms of all which, or at the
<pb facs="tcp:40331:104"/> leaſt the chief of them, and manner of uſing, we have aptly aſſign'd, and annex'd the reaſons as to the Preparations, as alſo the Operations and Effects of them. But that all is not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in this Tract that was omitted in the former, which yet I had hoped might have been, happens from the plenty of matter, and the bulk of the work encreaſing upon our hands: For aſſuredly, it is more than the task of one Man or Generation, to exhibit a compleat Curatory Method, and abſolute in all points. For if this Diſquiſition were more fully inſtituted as to its Latitude, not only all the <hi>Materia Medica</hi> (which is almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite) but alſo the whole Body of Phyſick offers it ſelf. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe our Attempts court not the name of Treatiſes, but of Eſſays. Truly it will not be needful for many Phyſicians, eſpecially thoſe who neglect the Phaenomena of Nature, being intent only on their Practice and Gain, to be learned about the Reaſons of all Remedies: but to the genuine Sons of Art, this will be of value, if not to direct, at leaſt to incite them to the Knowledge and ſerious weighing always of thoſe things they take in hand. And if theſe ſmall endeavours ſhall inſtigate others better to poliſh that Study, whatſoever Reviling I may reap from the malevolent and envious, it ſhall never repent me of my labour. For when I ſhall be well conſcious to my ſelf, that I have not ſuffered my Faculties although ſmall (as the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent entruſted with me by God Almighty) to periſh through ſloth, nor ſuffered them to be buryed in the earth, but that they may be rendred with ſome Intereſt beſide the Principal, it will much pleaſe me, nay, I ſhall ſeriouſly rejoyce and triumph.</p>

                     </gap>, that the Author, moſt worthy of Immortality, oppreſſed by the irreſiſtible aſſault of a Pleuriſie, is departed from among the Living; neither did the Arts profit their Maſter, which did all others. The Reader will pardon us, if we for a little ſpace celebrate the Funeral of ſo Sacred a Memory, nor eſteem it ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous to hear in a few words, what manner of perſon he was who wrote ſuch things: yea he will rejoyce to underſtand that he was equally Good as Learned, that he alſo exerciſed himſelf in the Practice of Piety, who was moſt converſant in that in Phyſick.</p>
                  <p>The matter requires a juſt Commentary, but we ſhall briefly propound what at firſt came into our ſudden thought, while our mind was ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with ſo unexpected an Accident.</p>
                  <p>Extracted from an honeſt Family, he had a Father educated in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous Studies, who after he had gone Maſter of Arts in the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> being taken with the retiredneſs of the Countrey, repaired to a Poſſeſſion he had near the ſame City, and ſolely attended his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick Affairs, and maintenance of his Family: being enough deſerving of the World, who begat ſuch a Son. But He, the Civil War raging, being ſnatcht away by the Contagion of a Camp-Feaver, left his Son an Orphan, near about twenty years of age, placing the firſt Rudiments of his Studies in <hi>Chriſt-Church;</hi> who being called to take on him the care of an Inheritance, for ſome time remained in the Countrey, but harraſed by the Incurſions of the Rebels, who were poſſeſſed of a Garriſon ſtrong enough Five miles from thence, and every where Plundering, he betook himſelf again to <hi>Oxford,</hi> being the Tents of the King as well as the Muſes; where liſting himſelf a Souldier in the Univerſity Legions, he received Pay for ſome years; untill the Cauſe of the Beſt Prince being overcome, <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Tyranny afforded to this wretched Nation a Peace more cruel than any War. From thence, the Church being trampled on, and Divinity together with Divines ſuppreſſed, he applyed himſelf to the ſtudy of Phyſick, in which, in a ſhort time he made eminent progreſs. In the mean time being neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs addicted to the ſtudy of Piety, (whereof it was a conſiderable demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, that when the Liturgy of the Church of <hi>England</hi> was thruſt out of the Church, and none could be preſent ſcot-free at thoſe holy Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces after the ancient manner) he entertained Religion then a Fugitive; and allotting part of his Houſe for Holy uſes, brought it ſo to paſs, that
<pb facs="tcp:40331:105"/> Aſſemblies, and Publick Prayers, and other Offices of Piety were conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly performed according to the Rites of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> In the mean time he writ and publiſhed thoſe moſt excellent Tracts by which he firſt became known to the World, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Fermentation,</hi> of <hi>Feavers, and of Urines.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At length the King reſtored, and acceſſe opened to Univerſity Degrees and publick Employs, he proceeded Doctor, and was publickly declared Profeſſor of Natural Philoſophy, which Profeſſion he did adorn with the higheſt praiſe; Moreover, his <hi>Anatomy of the Brain,</hi> and his Treatiſe of the <hi>Scurvy,</hi> and of <hi>Convulſions,</hi> were publiſhed.</p>
                  <p>But about the Year <hi>1667.</hi> being called to <hi>London</hi> to practiſe Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, it is incredible to relate, how ſoon, and with how great Commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he grew famous, eſpecially being ſo compoſed by Nature and Cuſtom, that he could not recommend himſelf by words compoſed to deceive, or the cunning Arts of Mountebanks. But though he ſpent whole dayes and nights in care of the Sick, he was yet at leiſure to adorn his Art by compoſing Books, from whence among a thouſand Interruptions he publiſhed theſe Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes, of <hi>the Accenſion of the Blood,</hi> and of <hi>Muſcular Motion,</hi> of <hi>the Soul of Brutes,</hi> of <hi>the Diſeaſes of the Brain,</hi> and the firſt part of his <hi>Pharmaceutice Rationalis,</hi> and at length the <hi>other</hi> which we now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. All which, with the Authors Animad verſions, and writings unpubliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, being collected into one Volume, and committed to the care of the moſt faithful Apothecary Mr. <hi>J. Hemming,</hi> we hope ſome time to print here.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, the ſame care for Divine Worſhip was ſtill impreſſed on this moſt Pious Soul; and ſince he could not be preſent, by reaſon of Employ, at the Canonical Hours at the Publick Devotion in the Pariſh Church where he dwelt, he procured the Sacred Offices of the Church to be there celebrated early in the Morning and late in the Evening, and for the moſt part was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant at them, whatever Buſineſs was repugnant. And ſeeing this Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion profitable to many in the Neighbourhood, who were likewiſe all day de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained about Commerce and Trades, he endowed a Prieſt with a fit Salary at his Death, to diſcharge that Function for ever.</p>
                  <p>But ſmall was this proof of his excellent Pious temper. Although no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon more frugal and attentive to his Employ, yet none more munificent, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying all things to himſelf, yet denying nothing to the Poor and helpleſs. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides what he beſtowed with his own hands, he provided Almſgivers and Diſpenſers of his Charity every where in the City, Countrey, and in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity. I ſpeak what I know by frequent experiment; one might eaſier have received from him, for a fit object of Charity, an hundred Crowns, than have extorted as many farthings from moſt others. And though any one might juſtly impute the large Revenues he acquired, to his indefatigable Diligence and conſtant Frugality, yet I believe it rather to proceed from
<pb facs="tcp:40331:106"/> his bountifull Largeſſes, and the Divine benediction thereon. From the beginning of his Youth to the laſt period of his life, he was Maſter of no ſumme of Money which he accounted his own, untill he had conſecrated ſome conſiderable Portion of it to God and the Poor: And when a few dayes before his laſt, which I muſt ever lament, we conferr'd together, (as if he had foreknown his approaching Death, and being more ſolicitous about the Poor than his own Offſpring,) he diligently adviſed about ſtating theſe Accompts.</p>
                  <p>I omit here to decipher, how undiſturbed he was in Adverſity, and how temperate in Proſperity; how modeſt in the higheſt Fame for his Learning; when unworthily provok'd, how prone to forgive Injuries; how faithful to his Prince to his death; how obedient to the oppreſſed Church; how candid and ingenuous in the Profeſſion of his Art; how indefatigable in his Studyes, how ſparing in his Speech, and how much a Chriſtian in the whole ſtate of his Life. To finiſh all which according to his deſerts, is not the work of one hour or Paragraph. In ſhort, he was conſtantly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in Prayers, Studyes, Labours, Almes, and Watchings; at length be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near Fifty ſeven years of Age, in the beginning of <hi>November</hi> he ſeemed troubled with a Cough (now the Epidemical Diſeaſe of the time) which (while it was thought light and inconſiderable) ſuddenly paſſed into a Pleuriſie and Peripneumonia. And when this moſt expert Perſon was not relieved by frequent Bleeding and diligent taking of Remedies, himſelf per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Period of his Life to approach, (his Friends hoping better;) and after three dayes his Houſhold affairs being ſettled, and having taken the <hi>Viaticum</hi> of the <hi>Holy Euchariſt,</hi> and being received into the Peace of the Church, he commended his pious Soul to God, having his ſenſes entire to the laſt breath, and finiſht his moſt exemplary Life with the like Death.</p>

                        <p>IN the former Treatiſe having eſſayed to explain the reaſons of every Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, for the moſt part we have toucht only upon general Medicines, namely which excite ſome Evacuation, or recreate and reſtore the fainting Spirits, or calm thoſe which are too much raging and unquiet:<note place="margin">The Authors pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent work.</note> But moreover there are many other Remedies, and thoſe of ſeveral ſorts, which are ſuppoſed to have reſpect to ſome peculiar part of the Body, or ſome particular Diſeaſe, and to be appropriated to thoſe ends by a certain kind of ſpecific virtue or operation. Now as concerning both the <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> of theſe, at leaſt the chief of them, <hi>viz.</hi> whether it be really ſo, and for what reaſon it comes to paſs to be ſo, it ſeems now worthy to be inquired into: And firſt of all we will treat of the Medicines of the <hi>Thorax, viz.</hi> thoſe that are wont to be preſcribed againſt the Cough, Phthiſic, Catarrh, Aſthma, Dyſpnoea, and other Diſeaſes of the Breaſt.</p>
                        <p>But ſince the reaſons as well of theſe Diſeaſes as of medicinal Operations in heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them ſeem very abſtruſe and moſt difficult to declare:<note place="margin">The parts of the Thorax.</note> therefore before I enter upon this task, ſomething ought to be premiſed about the parts themſelves, as well touching their uſes and ordinary actions, as their ſickneſſes or preternatural affects. As to the firſt, the parts of the <hi>Thorax</hi> are either principal, as the Heart and Lungs,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40331:115"/> with the Veſſels appendent unto them; or ſubſervient, as the Membranes and Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, with the Diaphragma; as likewiſe the Ribs, with the Vertebra's; the Pneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monic Veſſels, with the nervous Fibres and Glandules. The conſideration of the Heart and its Veſſels doth not properly belong to this place, becauſe not ſo much the ſickneſſes of the Breaſt alone as the general ſickneſſes of the whole body are uſually reckoned amongſt its paſſions.

                        <p>The ſubſtance of the Lungs was always accounted by the Ancients, and moſtly hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto by modern Authors for fleſh and a Parenchyma, like the frame of the other bowels; which notwithſtanding was accounted lighter and ſpongeous (for as much as it was apt to be diſtended much by air pufft in,<note place="margin">The ſubſtance of the Lungs alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous.</note> and to float upon waters.)

If you lightly open in one ſingle lobe of the Lung one of theſe inter-ſpaces with the point of a knife, and ſhall blow into it by a ſmall hole through a Pipe, preſently that whole lobe will be very much extended, every inter-ſpace being pufft up; and then if you bring this frame to the light, the inter-ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces being made tranſparent, do ſeven by great intervals every lobe very conſpicuous; and ſo every rank of the lobes will appear like a Polypody leaf, and under the ſame figures, as <hi>Malpighius</hi> hath deſcribed, and are repreſented in Fig. 2. of our third Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. But when the little lobes are filled and extended by liquor eaſily congealing caſt

The Veins and Arteries every where accompany this production of the <hi>Aſpera Arteria,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend themſelves through the whole ſubſtance of the Lungs by a certain knitting and alike branching. This is plainly perceived by a pleaſant ſight, in a lobe of the Lungs being emptied and turgid, Quick-ſilver being caſt into ſome of the Veſſels, and others filled with a coloured liquor. But in diſſecting the living, another ſort of Veſſels, <hi>viz.</hi> Lymphaeducts are manifeſt to the eye to be ſpread through the whole Lungs:<note place="margin">The Lymphae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts and ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſlips.</note> and we have in another place clearly enough ſhewn, both very many Nerves and ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſlips every where to be diſtributed through them. Beſides theſe parts, and the primary or chief veſſels of a Lung, ſome others, and thoſe as it were ſecondary, are to be obſerved. For the Pneumonic Veins and Arteries are endued with other ſanguiferous Veſſels ſpringing from the <hi>Aorta,</hi> moreover with Glandules, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with Fibres as well nervous as moving; and the Wind-pipe is endowed with every one of theſe, and cartilaginous ones beſides.</p>
                        <p>Whence we may infer, that the entire frame of a Lung is meerly fiſtulous,<note place="margin">The Veſſels of a Lung.</note> and compacted of Pipes of ſeveral kinds and magnitude, and variouſly and moſt intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cately diſpoſed: which although they may appear wonderfully complicated, and many ways twiſted and wreathed, are yet every where continuous, and being ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out with a mutual reſpect to one another, do hither and thither in good order and regularly convey and diſpoſe the air, the blood, the <hi>Lympha,</hi> and animal Spirits for ſome acceſſary uſes. To deſcribe as it were with a Pencil this bulk of a Lung, together with the branchings, ſeparatings, and mutual complications of all its Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, would be no leſs difficult a task than to trace the ſeveral threads of a harl of ſilk, and their reſpect one to another. Nevertheleſs, that both the Pathology of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> and the cure, may be duly known according to our deſign, it ſeems to be material to recite here all the Veſſels of the Lungs one after another, and to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver as well their deſcriptions, as their preternatural uſes and diſeaſes, to which at length the Therapeutic Method ſhall be ſubjoyned. And theſe are the Veſſels of which the entire fabrick of the Lungs conſiſts, the Wind-pipe, with the <hi>Bronchia</hi> and little Bladders, Arteries, Veins, Lymphaeducts, and Nerves, to which may the parts and appendices of thoſe Veſſels be added, <hi>viz.</hi> the Coats of the greater Veſſels, which are endued with other ſanguiferous Veſſels and Glandules, and alſo with ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Muſcles and Fibres.</p>
                        <p>Therefore as to the chief Veſſels of the Lungs, although all theſe, by reaſon of their mutual offices, communicate among themſelves with a wonderful affinity; yet the Arteries and Pneumonic Veins attend on the <hi>Trachea</hi> and its partitions the moſt exactly;<note place="margin">Wait on the Trachea.</note> for the branches and ſprigs of every one of theſe ſpringing alike from their reſpective ſtocks, and ſtretcht out to and fro, go on every where with like pace; ſo that the <hi>Trachea</hi> and its branches are always in the middle, above that the Vein, and beneath the Pneumonic Artery are carried, and all are diſtributed with an equal and ſociable branching: and the ſprigs and branches, ſent from each of them, are preſently applied to their like, and are interwoven like wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Nets, of which the texture of the Lungs is almoſt totally conſtituted. It will be impoſſible to deſcribe the ſpreadings out and various complications among themſelves of all theſe going on together, as to the leſſer ſprigs and ſlips; yet if you will caſt into every veſſel apart Quick-ſilver, hot and flowing Gypſum, Wax min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled and made liquid with Oyl of Turpentine, or ſome ſuch matter, which will extend all or the chief paſſages, and continue them ſtufft, then you may exactly enough repreſent the figure: and after that manner the frame or texture of the whole Lung may be conceived, each being deſcribed by it ſelf and apart. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon theſe and all other Veſſels and parts of the Lungs we will treat in order; and firſt of the <hi>Trachea</hi> or Wind-pipe.</p>
                        <p>The Wind-pipe or <hi>Aſpera Arteria</hi> is a Pipe ſomewhat long,<note place="margin">The deſcription of the Trachea.</note> conſiſting of Griſles and Membranes, which beginning from the Throat or loweſt part of the Jaws, and leaning on the Gullet, and deſcending into the Lungs, is diſperſed by manifold little branchings through their whole frame. It is divided into two parts by the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, <hi>viz.</hi> the upper, which is called the <hi>Larynx,</hi> and the nether commonly called <hi>Bronchus;</hi> to which a third or loweſt is added, by <hi>Malpighius</hi> called <hi>Veſicularis,</hi> or the bladdery one.</p>
                        <p>The former of theſe, which is the beginning of the <hi>Aſpera Arteria,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">The deſcription of the Larynx.</note> doth chiefly
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40331:116"/> ſerve for vociferation or loud noiſe, formed of many and various Griſles, to which alſo are adjoyned proper Muſcles; the deſcription and uſe of all which are ſo exactly delivered by Anatomiſts, that there is no need of dwelling longer on the deſcription: we only advertiſe for methods ſake and by way of abridgment, that the Larynx con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains ſome greater Cartilages of divers forms, and ſome uniform; the former, by reaſon of reſemblance, bear the denomination of <hi>Epiglottis,</hi> the Buckler-like Carti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, the Ring-Griſle, and <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>. To this laſt doth ſucceed a continual rank or row of Cartilages, faſhioned altogether after the ſame figure and manner; every one of which, whereas they reſemble a circle, but not compleat, are diſpoſed after ſuch a ſort, as if one ſo compoſe many wooden Rings, that there ſhould grow up from the ſides of them, by laying a good many one upon another, a certain Pipe as it were with Ribs. Theſe circular Cartilages are equally diſtant one from another in their whole paſſage, and are knit together by the benefit of an inner Membrane (which fills up the ſpaces between like the <hi>Perioſtium</hi>) as with a ligament. But the hinder part of every Ring-like Griſle where it lies upon the Gullet, that it may ſerve better to the ſwallowing of meats, turns into a Membrane, which altogether is the ſame, and binding together thoſe cartilaginous rings, and covering the whole hollowneſs of the <hi>Larynx,</hi> is always moiſt with an unctuous humour, by which it may as well be defended againſt the ſucking in of ſharper air, as breathing out more acrimonious vapours.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Membranes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſing the wind-pipe.</note>Beſides this inner Membrane, alſo another outward, though thinner, encompaſſes the whole Wind-pipe, by the aid whereof both the Cartilages are more firmly knit among themſelves, and the whole Pipe bound to its neighbouring parts, and deſcends more ſafely and ſtrongly into the Breaſt. Beſides, we judge there are ſome other uſes and offices of either Membrane, than that it only ſerve to faſhion or defend the ſides of the Wind-pipe: for as much as we do here manifeſtly obſerve many Nerves and nervous ſtrings every where inſerted, and alſo the more inward Coat of the <hi>Aſpera Arteria</hi> to be endued with Fibres, as well nervous as fleſhy or muſculous: from whence we may conclude the Wind-pipe to injoy both a certain ſenſe and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion either in the whole, or at leaſt in ſome parts. And truly it is manifeſt even to common obſervation, that its more inward paſſage doth excel with a moſt acute ſenſe; for as much as it is ſo much provoked by the ſmalleſt prejudice, that preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is wonderfully forced into a convulſive motion, <hi>viz.</hi> a Cough: but as a ſenſe of annoyance, and from thence very often an inſtinct of motion ariſes from this Veſſel; ſo we think that its Fibres do after a ſort move of themſelves both in breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and coughing. Surely in reſpect of this it is not to be doubted, becauſe in this inner Membrane we find two orders of muſcular Fibres in that faſhion diſpoſed as in the <hi>Aorta</hi> and Inteſtines: to wit, there is one upper order of ſtraight Fibres, which while they are contracted, make all the circular Cartilages to be drawn together nearer to one another, and for that cauſe to abbreviate the Trunk of this Veſſel ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to all its parts ſucceſſively. Under this lies another order of circular Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres, which (while they are pufft up) being contracted, the hollowneſs of the Wind-pipe is much narrowed. Therefore when the moving Fibres of either kind make the paſſage to be ſtraitned according to all its dimenſions, it is obvious enough that they conduce to the diſcharge of the function of breathing, and more or leſs to be active, as there is endeavour to breathe quicker or ſlower, more intenſly or more remiſs. Theſe Fibres being more vehemently contracted in a Cough, in hawking, in blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, and certain other more ſtrong exerciſes of expiration, do force the breath and other contents of the <hi>Aſpera Arteria</hi> to be violently expelled. Moreover from this action ſometimes either depraved or hindred, it ſhall be declared hereafter how an Aſthma, a Dyſpnoea, and ſome other diſeaſes about breathing do ariſe.</p>

For as in another place we have remarked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Anatomy of the ſanguiferous Artery, one may alſo here take notice, that the inward Pipe of the Wezand is covered with a moſt thick weaving of Veſſels of every kind, and eſpecially of thoſe carrying blood, in faſhion of a Net.

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40331:116"/> Weazand, under which folding of Veſſels very ſmall and whitiſh Glandules are every where ſtrewed, or rather cleave to them; juſt in the like manner, as we have in another place ſhewn to be in moſt other greater Veſſels, and in all membranous Bowels: on all which the Lymphaeducts adjoyned do wait. As to the uſe of theſe, without doubt the Arteries and Veins waſh through the Pipe of the Weazand with bloody ſtream for its nouriſhment; and the Nerves carry plenty of Spirits, and the faculty of performing motions to the muſcular Fibres. Afterwards whatſoever of ſuperfluous moiſture be left by the Arteries, that the Veins cannot bring back, the Glandules do receive and retain, until it may be ſent back to the maſs of blood through the Lymphaeducts. When they are too much filled, by reaſon of the Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha more plentifully left, a humour diſtilling from the Glandules as well as from the Arteries into the hollowneſs of the Wind-pipe brings a Catarrh. All the Coats of the <hi>Aſpera Arteria</hi> diſtinct and ſeparated from each other are expreſſed in the ſeventh Table.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond part of the Wind-pipe, commonly called <hi>Bronchos,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Of the Bronchia.</note> begins from the entrance of the Lungs: for near the fourth Vertebra of the Cheſt that great Pipe deſcending, is divided into two Trunks, one whereof goes towards the right ſide of the Lungs, the other the left: afterwards both having entred the Lungs, and being ſubdivided for the greater Lobes, diſtribute very many ſprigs (as for the moſt part in the gills of fiſhes) to the Lobes or leſſer Lobes through the whole frame of the Lungs. The paſſages of all theſe are furniſhed, even as in the Larynx, with Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilages, but framed ſomething in a differing manner: for in the <hi>Bronchia</hi> theſe are not Ring-like, but reſembling a Coat of Male, ſo that when there is need to contract thoſe paſſages, the inferiour Cartilage goes under the hollowneſs of the upper, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in the ſame manner as it is in the joynts of the ſhelly Coat of a Lobſter. Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is ſo made by the work of God, that when the Lungs are dilated, the <hi>Bronchia</hi> are ſtretcht out into the greateſt length; and when they are contracted, the <hi>Bron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia</hi> are abbreviated, one part being drawn into another.</p>
                        <p>The Coats of the <hi>Bronchia,</hi> as alſo of the Larynx,<note place="margin">Their Syſtole and Diaſtole.</note> have muſcular Fibres of both kinds, together with the Glandules and the Net like twiſting of Veſſels: from whence we may alſo conclude, that all the leſſer Pipes of the <hi>Aſpera Arteria</hi> have their conſtant turns of Syſtole and Diaſtole, <hi>viz.</hi> all the Pipes are contracted while we breathe out, and relaxed while we ſuck in air: moreover from the ſame Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules and little Net of Veſſels every where continued almoſt within every inward receſs of the Lungs, doth diſtil the Catarrh humour. A certain Bronchial branch of the <hi>Trachea</hi> belonging to each Lobe of the Lungs is deſcribed in the ſecond Table <hi>H. H.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And the branched <hi>Bronchia</hi> of both ſides not only conſtitute two or more greater Lobes; but, as <hi>Malpighius</hi> hath obſerved,<note place="margin">The Lobes of the Bronchia.</note> many leſſer or little lobes diſtinct among themſelves; for each Bronchial branch ſends forth to and fro many little branches or twigs, every of which twigs being joyned with alike twigs of the Pneumonic Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Vein, from thence are parted into innumerable leſſer ſprigs; all which being every where fellowed and complicated among themſelves, and having got Nerves and peculiar Lymphaeducts, and ending in the outward ſuperficies of the Lungs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent as it were a certain private Grove; and ſo the whole ſtructure of the Lungs conſiſts of many little branches of the aforeſaid Veſſels complicated, as it were of ſo many ſeveral Groves. The branches whereof and outmoſt ſides of which,<note place="margin">Their little bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings disjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from one the other.</note> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they may ſeem mutually to touch themſelves and cleave together, yet they are disjoyned one from the other, and are every one bounded within their proper limits; far otherwiſe than the productions and communications of Veſſels are in the Brain, where the Arteries and Veins riſing up in its ſeveral corners, extend on every ſide, and creeping through its whole ſpace, and mutually inoſculating, do all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate among themſelves.</p>
                        <p>That former faſhioning of the Veſſels hath been very neceſſary to the uſes of the Lungs;<note place="margin">The uſe of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid frame.</note> for ſeeing the air ought only to enter the Lungs for that end that it might pour out to the blood nitrous particles for its flame and vitality of life, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently return back; and ſeeing the blood doth paſs through the Lungs for that cauſe, that it might meet the air ſuckt in according to all its parts; therefore it behoves that both theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the air and the blood be divided into ſmall portions, and with theſe make every where diſtinct and ſhort meetings. The manner of this is moſt elegantly perceived in the gills of fiſhes; for ſeeing the <hi>Bronchia</hi> are as
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40331:117"/> ſo many greater Lobes, every one of theſe is divided into many rundles, furniſhed with a complication of every kind of Veſſels, as if it were into ſo many Lobes; in every one of which the blood is drawn out by minute portions, as it were little rivu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, that it might throughly meet with the nitrous particles, and afterwards return into its chanel.</p>

                           <note place="margin">The uſes of the little bladdery cells.</note>The Bronchial Pipes lead into the utter cavities, <hi>viz.</hi> into the numerous little Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders diſcovered by <hi>Malpighius;</hi> which truly are certain continued parts of the <hi>Aſpera Arteria,</hi> but diſtinct from the former, becauſe the Griſles are wholly wanting to them, and, which ſupply the turn of theſe, are diſtant one from another in larger ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: for all the Bronchial branches ſend forth leſſer ſlips from themſelves every way; whoſe paſſages, although void of Griſles, notwithſtanding are ſtraitned as it were with certain ligaments at certain intervals; and the ſpaces between theſe being filled with air ſuckt in do make partly thoſe ſmall bladdery little Cells. In truth thoſe paſſages may not unaptly be compared to the Gut Colon of a Mouſe, whoſe continued hollowneſs in as much as it is girt about in divers places, ſeems to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided as it were into many little purſes. Moreover thoſe bladdery paſſages being ſhorter on either ſide the <hi>Sinus</hi> or hollowneſs, have as it were particular little Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders growing thick to them, and therefore the heap of all the Cells ſeems not much unlike to a bunch of Grapes. The Figures of theſe as much as may be are exactly repreſented in the third Table. Thoſe little bladdery Cells, that they may put forth their contracting endeavours for breathing, have muſcular Fibres, as is plainly ſeen by the Microſcope. For as much as great plenty of air ought to be drawn within the Lungs, and reſerved in part, leſt it fail at any time; therefore beſides thoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per paſſages which are as it were the threſhold and dens, moreover more inner chambers and capacious are required, in which the air may be treaſured up, and from thence be diſpenſed upon occaſion.

Moreover it cannot be drawn in or inſpired otherwhile in quantity great enough, as in running, ſinging, or much ſpeaking, alſo in ſome crazy diſpoſitions; and in that caſe the inward air being rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, ſupplies in a manner the defect of the outward.</p>

                           <note place="margin">The deſcription and uſe of the Pneumonic Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.</note>2. The next Veſſel is the Pneumonic Artery, of whoſe moſt thick branches ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended every where to and fro, and with other branches twiſted and complicated together, the frame of the Lungs conſiſts. This Artery iſſuing from the right <hi>Sinus</hi> of the Heart, and inclining towards the <hi>Trachea,</hi> is parted into a right and left branch; which applying themſelves to the like parallel branches of the <hi>Trachea,</hi> do accompany them every where, or rather are ſet under them; for they are planted beneath, and are firſt carried into the greater lobes of the Lungs, and afterwards into all the leſſer lobes: in every of which the little branch of the Artery ſtretched out, ſends out on either ſide more ſlips from it ſelf, which preſently are aſſociated by other bronchial and venal ſlips, and are ſeveral ways complicated; and where the outmoſt ſprigs of the <hi>Aſpera Arteria</hi> depart into circular little Cells, the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries being complicated with the Veins (as is diſcovered by the Microſcope) do girt about thoſe little Bladders with their thick branching, and enwrap them like Ivy: from whence we may conjecture, that it is not for nothing that the Blood-veſſels that are any where in the Lungs, do curiouſly wait upon thoſe of the air, and every where inſinuate and intimately mingle themſelves. Surely whatſoever hath been ſuppoſed by others, I ſhall not eaſily believe that this is done for the more exact
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40331:117"/> mingling of the Blood and its parts, be they never ſo unlike. For to do that, what need would there be of ſo full an acceſs of air, which in rightly making other mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures (the more perfect whereof are called Digeſtions) we ſeek as much as we can to keep out? For if the air might freely come and go, the Particles that ſhould be mixed, would moſt of them flye away. And as to that which is affirmed, That the Blood in the Lungs is carried through thoſe ſmall, winding and extreme narrow paſſages only that it may be the better mixed; I ſay, that its being ſo carried is quite contrary to ſuch an intention: for the beſt mixture of any liquor (as alſo of the Blood it ſelf) is made by fermentation; and the liquour to be ſo mixed or fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, like Wine in a Hogſhead, requires a free and ſpacious room: but its going through theſe ſmall and narrow paſſages like ſo many ſtrainers, ſerves rather for the ſeparation than the mixture of its parts; wherefore unleſs the Blood be exactly mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the greater Veſſels, and be there rightly fermented, it does, while it paſſes through the Lungs, leave there the dregs and whatſoever parts are not rightly mixt, and ſo does ſtuff up and very much obſtruct their paſſages; as we may ſee in perſons affected with the Green-ſickneſs, Cachexy, and that ſort of Dropſie called <hi>Leuco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlegmatia,</hi> who all have a difficulty of breathing, by reaſon of dregs of the ill-mixt Blood that are left there. Wherefore the uſe of the Lungs ſeems to be this, That the Blood through the leſſer Veſſels, as ſo many rivulets, may as to all its parts lie open to and meet with the nitrous Particles of the Air, and be by them enlivened and accended. The Pneumonic Artery, as alſo the <hi>Aorta</hi> and Wind pipe, hath a muſcular Coat furniſhed with two ranks of Fibres, namely ſtraight and circular; which doubtleſs, when they are contracted, do make the Pneumonic Arteries to beat, and the Blood to be urged and driven ſtill more and more forward. A great many Glandules with a Net of Veſſels lie on this muſculous Coat. The frame and branching of the Pneumonic Artery in ſome one Lobe of the Lungs are expreſſed in the ſecond Table. All the Coats of this Veſſel are drawn diſtinct and apart from one another in the ſixth Table and firſt Figure, and alſo in the fourth Table and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Figure.</p>
                        <p>The Pneumonic Vein, having its riſe in the left Ventricle of the Heart,<note place="margin">The deſcription and uſe of the Pneumonic Vein.</note> and being divided and variouſly ſubdivided firſt into greater branches, and then, according to the greater and leſſer Lobes of the Lungs, into leſſer, and laſtly into the leaſt of all, is carried above the Weazand, and as it goes on does exactly anſwer to the branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both of the Pneumonic Artery and the Weazand, and goes every where with them as it were cheek by joll; and where the Weazand ends into the little Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, the Veins being twiſted with the Arteries (as was ſaid before) do make as it were a little Net wherein thoſe little Bladders are encompaſſed. The Anatome of the Pneumonic Vein differs little or nothing from that of the <hi>Vena cava</hi> and its branches. All the Veſſels of this kind have four Coats diſtinct from one another.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The outmoſt of theſe Coats conſiſts of Fibres that ſeem to be nervous, which perhaps are after a ſort muſcular and are extended ſtraight long-wiſe, (though in no very regular order.) This Coat of the pulmonary Vein is very laxe, and looſe from the reſt of the Veſſel, inſomuch that it may all of it be blown up and very much extended, as if it were a diſtinct Veſſel: Whence one might ſuſpect that this were a peculiar paſſage to carry back <hi>Lympha</hi> or <hi>Serum</hi> ſeparated from the Blood: but it ſeems to be more probable, that this outmoſt Coat is therefore made ſo looſe, that the paſſages might be much diſtended and widened for the return of the Blood now hot and boiling.</p>

                        <p n="4">4. The fourth and inmoſt Coat is plainly muſcular, having Ring-fibres,<note place="margin">The muſcular Coat.</note> as the like Coat of an Artery hath, which certainly being ſucceſſively contracted after the ſtream of Blood, do cauſe its return to be haſtened, and on occaſion to be ſhortned. But here ariſes a doubt, wherefore,<note place="margin">Why there is no Pulſe in the Veins.</note> ſeeing the Veins as well as Arteries have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting muſcular Fibres (which in the latter are pulſifick) and ſeeing both are alike joined to the Heart that beats continually, the Veins as well as the Arteries ſhould not ſtatedly beat according to the conſtant turns of the Syſtole's and Diaſtole's in the Heart? It may eaſily be anſwered to this, <hi>firſt,</hi> that the Arteries have a great deal more of the moving Fibres than the Veins have; and therefore whereas <hi>thoſe</hi>
                           <pb n="8" facs="tcp:40331:118"/> being ſtrongly contracted ſucceſſively, do force the Blood along as if driven with a wedge, for <hi>theſe</hi> it ſufficeth that whilſt they are gently contracted behind the ſtream of Blood, they calmly and equally drive it forward, flowing back again of its own accord, and as it were down-hill. But <hi>beſides,</hi> the reaſon hereof ſeems to depend ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what on the unlike or rather inverted conformation of the Veſſels; for the Blood conveighed by the Arteries is driven ſtill from wider to narrower ſpaces, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore going along it every where violently diſtends them, and lifting up the ſides of the Veſſels raiſes the Pulſe; becauſe whiles that part of the Artery that is behind the Blood is contracted by its muſcular Fibres, that part which is before it, muſt needs beat being filled with the ſtream of blood guſhing in: but on the contrary, the blood in the Veins returning to the Heart, runs out of leſs into greater ſpaces, or out of rivu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets into a more capacious and deep chanel, and therefore glides along ſilently and without the fluctuating of a Pulſe.</p>

                           <note place="margin">The diſpoſition of the blood in the Pneumonic Veins.</note>The blood in the pulmonary Veins ſeems as much, or more than that within the Arteries to be animated or inflamed anew by the air inſinuating it ſelf every where from the Pipes or little Bladders of the <hi>Trachea,</hi> becauſe in thoſe Veins 'tis firſt changed from a black-purple to a ſcarlet: the reaſon whereof is, becauſe the blood at the extremities of the Veſſels, namely as it paſſes out of the Arteries into the Veins, does every where and moſt of all meet with the particles of the air. And for that reaſon it is, that if any liquour be ſquirted into the Pneumonic Artery, it will not ſo readily and quickly paſs through the Lungs and return by the Vein, as it will do if you make the ſame experiment in any member, or part of the body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides; yea part of the liquor ſo injected will ſweat through into the Pipes of the <hi>Trachea,</hi> or the ſpaces between the little Lobes, and another part, being turned into a froth, will return very ſlowly by the Veins: which is a certain proof, that while it paſſes through the Lungs it makes a ſtay in the mouths of the Veſſels, and is mingled with the airy particles. The Circulation of the blood through the Lungs hath ſomething diverſe from, or rather contrary to that which is made through the reſt of the body; ſeeing the Pneumonic Arteries contain a black-purple blood, and the Veins a ſcarlet, whereas in all the body beſides the branches of the <hi>Aorta</hi> carry a ſcarlet blood, and thoſe of the <hi>Vena cava</hi> a black-purple. Beſides we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve of the pulmonary Vein, that it does every where in its whole length want valves, except where 'tis faſtned to the Heart. Which appears by this, that when any liquor is injected into its trunk (juſt as it is in the Artery) it preſently paſſes through all its branches without lett. Which ought to be ſo, to this end, that the blood may always, becauſe of the violence of the paſſions, freely every way fluctuate and regurgitate in and about the Heart. Beſides, that the left Ventricle of the Heart might never be overcharged with the blood impetuouſly ruſhing into it, by the inſtinct of Nature the Fibres at the root of the Vein being contracted, its courſe might be inverted and flow back. The deſcription of the Pneumonic Vein as to its utmoſt branching is in the fourth Table and third Figure.</p>

A power of theſe diſperſed through the Lungs, wait on the Arteries and Veins. All the branches tending from the ſurface of the Lung towards its original, unite into ſome greater trunks; which, being inſerted into the Wind-pipe, diſcharge thereinto the Lympha that is ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous from the blood and nervous humour. Indeed there is need of a great many of this ſort of Veſſels in the Lungs; becauſe, ſeeing the blood is hotteſt of all here, is haſtily circulated, and yet can exhale nothing to without by tranſpiration, the Veins can hardly receive all the whole maſs of blood from the Arteries; and the Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules contain not long what is depoſited in them: therefore there as need of Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaeducts as ſo many chanels, whereby the ſuperfluous humour might continually be ſent off. If theſe at any time happen to be obſtructed or broken, there often fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows a Dropſie of the Lungs or Breaſt, and ſometimes Coughs and Phthiſicks. Theſe lymphatick Veſſels of the Lungs may very well be ſeen, if in diſſecting a live Dog you preſs the top of the Thoracick duct, that nothing may be poured into the ſubcla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian Vein: for then the Lymphaeducts of the Lungs, becauſe they cannot diſcharge themſelves into the common Receptacle now ſtopt and filled, ſwell much and are very apparent. If ſuch a ſtoppage be made for ſome time in a Dog that hath eat and drunk largely, a milky liquor will ſweat into the Lungs out of the Thoracick duct, the Valves being unlocked: yea and the ſame liquor will paſs through the Lymphae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40331:118"/> placed far beneath the Reins, and will render them ſtrutted with that humour, as if abounding with milk.

Heretofore doubting about the office of theſe, we were induced to think the firſt force, or at leaſt inſtinct of breathing depended on theſe Nerves; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe otherwiſe we can hardly conceive, after what manner the motion of the Lungs in breathing, coughing, laughing, and other their actions ſhould be always ſo exactly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned according to the ſeveral exigences of Nature. For even as the blood doth more intenſly or remiſly heat and boil up within the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> and as certain contents of the <hi>Trachea</hi> provoke the nervous Fibres, we breathe either quicker or ſlower, and oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, though unwillingly, we cough. But beſides there doth occur another and more neceſſary uſe of theſe Nerves: for ſince it is manifeſt, that the Coats of thoſe Veins and of the <hi>Trachea</hi> are every where endued with muſcular or moving Fibres by which they are contracted, it is plain, that the Pneumonic Nerves do convey as well plenty of ſpirits, as inclinations of contraction to thoſe Fibres. And it is very probable from thoſe Nerves convulſively diſtempered, that the Palpitation of the Heart is often exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as alſo the Aſthma and Chin cough. We have ſome time ſince delivered the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy or deſcription of the Pneumonic Nerves in our Treatiſe of Nerves, <hi>viz. pag.</hi> 311. ſo that there is here no need to repeat or inlarge. The fivefold Veſſels forementioned being mutual, and many ways accompanied in their diſtribution, as if divided into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Groves with ſmall bladders as in Trenches every where interwoven, when they are complicated and variouſly woven together do conſtitute a fleſhy web, which is the very ſtructure of the Lungs: which moreover appears like a more ſolid <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> in as much the Arteries and Veins being filled with blood are ſtufft up, and the Veſſels of the <hi>Trachea</hi> and Lymphaeducts being emptied of the air as well as water, do fall together and ſeem to cloſe. We ſhall the leſs admire the fleſhy fabrick of this Lung wove to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether out of meer Veſſels and little Bladders, if we conſider the frame of the ſeminal Teſticles to be nothing elſe than a heap compoſed of hollow filaments or ſpermatic Pipes woven together. The deſcription of the Nerves of the Lung, and what relates to the bundle of Fibres whereof it is compact, and to the ſpreading of its branches, are deſcribed in the fifth Table.</p>
                        <p>The web of the Lung, as above-ſaid,<note place="margin">The Coats of the lungs, whereof one is ſmooth, and the other rough.</note> being weaved together of Veſſels and little Bladders, and divided according to their greater and leſſer branchings into lobes and little lobes, a Membrane wraps them about as a common covering. Of this there are two Coats, <hi>viz.</hi> one outer and fine, which appears like a certain ſubtle texture or wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving together of nervous filaments (as is apparent in moſt other Bowels;) the other more inward, which is both rough and ſomewhat thick, and conſiſting almoſt of meer ends of Veſſels and little Bladders: and by reaſon of the hollowneſſes every where cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from theſe, its inward ſuperficies reſembles a Hive of Bees; the forms of theſe are aptly enough deſcribed in the eighth Table. This Membrane of two Coats blown up hath very many and large Pores, inſomuch that if Quick-ſilver be poured into the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial branch of one of the leſſer lobes, almoſt filling within the whole Membrane, it will every where burſt out from the Pores. Both the arterial blood and the air beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this Membrane as againſt a bank, are reflected; the former is brought back by the Veins into the left Venter of the Heart, a certain watry part being ſent away through the Lymphaeducts. In the mean while the air is returned back by the ſame paſſages of the <hi>Trachea</hi> by which it flowed in. For continually freſh air ought to be ſuckt in, that it might ſupply nitrous Particles to the Blood; to make room for which the other old air being now weak and uſeleſs, muſt be firſt breathed out. Becauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both functions are to be performed within the ſame paſſages, it is to be done by alternate turns, firſt the one, then the other. While the air is drawn in, the Lungs are blown up, as if wind were forced into them; and whilſt the ſame is breathed out they fall down, and are narrowly ſqueezed together for the benefit of excluding it; and ſo after the manner of Bellows diſcharge conſtant changes of the Syſtole and Diaſtole. Yet by what impulſe and Organs it is accompliſhed, is worth our labour here to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider.</p>
                        <p>Therefore upon the whole matter it is manifeſt by common obſervation,<note place="margin">The Syſtole and Diaſtole of a Lung.</note> the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtole of the Lungs perpetually ſucceeds the opening the Breaſt, and its Syſtole in like manner its contraction; ſo that we may conclude, when the cavity of the <hi>Thorax</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40331:119"/> dilated a greater ſpace is yielded to the expanſion of the lungs, the extern air of its own accord leaps into the <hi>Trachea,</hi> whether by reaſon of the Pulſe, or by its own Elaſtic force (for it is all one) and preſently enters into its Trunk, the <hi>bronchia</hi> and all the little bladders, and blows them up; namely for that end, that its nitrous particles may every where occur to the blood, waſhing all parts of the lungs: after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards when the breaſt receding from that dilatation, is ſtraitned as to its cavity, even the lung being compreſs'd, falls together by its Diaſtole, and excludes the air even now breath'd in. But truly, becauſe the air doth not of its own accord leap out with that plenty as it skipt in, neither the hollowneſs of the breaſt ſo ſtraitly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, that it ſhould mightily compreſs the lungs; therefore all the paſſages of the <hi>Trachea</hi> are endowed with muſcular fibres, which being contracted orderly while we breathe out, they may promote the expulſion of air. Wherefore, that the cauſe of breathing, and the manner of doing it may more plainly be made known, inquiſition ought to be made after what manner, and by what Organs, that interchangeable dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and contraction of the breaſt are performed.</p>

But the declination of the ribs from right angles into oblique, and the aſcenſion of the Diaphragma, is related to be the natural poſition of theſe parts, becauſe they are found in ſuch a ſcituation in dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. I think my aſſent not eaſily owing to this opinion, becauſe ſometimes the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of exſpiration is performed much ſtronger and more violently than that of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, as in coughing, ſinging, laughing, hollowing, and in other affects whoſe exerciſes are the more difficult labour and more earneſt endeavours of the breaſt. Wherefore there is no reaſon that we ſhould think that ſuch vigorous exerciſes of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration, ſhould be excited by the meer reſt and ceaſing of the aforeſaid muſcles, but from the motion of others oppoſed to them. Moreover the Muſcles now cited and oppoſite, and ſtraitning the breaſt, ſeem to be required not only by reaſon of their violent exſpiration, but for their ordinary and conſtant ſervice; at leaſt for the poiſing the function of reſpiration: for otherwiſe thoſe other whoſe office it is to enlarge the cavity of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> being ſometimes unmindfull of their task, do it either ſtronger or longer than is convenient; wherefore it is neceſſary they be forthwith admoniſhed by others, <hi>viz.</hi> their Antagoniſts ſubſervient to Expiration, and to be reſtrained in their duty. But the muſcles appointed for the ſtraitning the breaſt, are the <hi>Sacrolum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> the Triangular, and inward Intercoſtals, and ſome muſcles of the Abdomen; the uſe and deſcriptions of all which are delivered by many Anatomiſts, and moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately by <hi>Fallopius.</hi> The inner intercoſtal muſcles as they obtain a contrary ſcitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo a contrary function to the outer intercoſtals, which namely is to depreſs the ribs, and to ſtraiten the cavity of the breaſt, by forcing it into the <hi>Rhomboidal</hi> Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure. For we are to obſerve, that the carneous and thicker baſis of each of theſe is implanted in the loweſt part of the nether ribs, and the moving fibres, aſcending from thence obliquely and forward, and dividing croſs-wiſe the reſt of the outward inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſtals, with their ſmaller and Tendony end are engrafted in the bottom of the upper-rib; hence none need doubt, but that theſe inner muſcles do depreſs all the ribs, or bring them downward: but whilſt theſe ribs are ſo depreſs'd, that the trunk of the breaſt is rendred more ſtrait, theſe inward muſcles (otherwiſe than the outer) do not only incline the ribs downward, but alſo their griſtly or cartilaginous proceſſes. For <hi>Fallopius</hi> hath acutely deſcribed this: <hi>That the outward intercoſtal muſcles do onely fill up the inter-ſpaces of the ribs and not of the griſtles, but the inward fill up both ſpaces.</hi> The reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſeems to be after this manner, affording a moſt delightfull ſpeculation of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Architect,</hi> viz. while the ribs are brought upwards to the exerciſe of fetching in breath, and are withall drawn back towards the Spine, that motion commencing back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, is performed by the ribs themſelves; which being firſt moved together, the cartilages eaſily diſcharge their function as cords fitted to that purpoſe: wherefore there ſeems little need of the muſcular aid to place theſe in their order; but to put the ribs in action, not onely the intercoſtal muſcles afore mentioned, but the four other greater ones do continually endeavour it; but on the contrary, that the ribs may be depreſs'd and brought forwards together, the force taking its riſe before, is performed by the cartilages as ſo many leading cords, moſt eaſily bending the ribs downwards as far as need requires.</p>
                        <p>Moreover to this end, that the cartilaginous appendices of the ribs may be drawn down and nearer one the other for the exerciſe of expiration, not onely the inward intercoſtal muſcles fill as well the intervals of the cartilages as of the ribs, but more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over an entire triangular muſcle is allotted for this function; for this ſpringing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath from the bone of the Sternon, and aſcending upwards obliquely, is inſerted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40331:120"/> the lower Cartilages, which it conſtrains towards its head, and bends the <hi>Thorax</hi> nearer on the other ſide. That is worthy of conſideration, which <hi>Fallopius</hi> hath remarked touching this muſcle, <hi>viz.</hi> whereas it is ſo little and minute in a man, that it may hardly be allowed for a Muſcle, it is ſtretched out in a Dog along the whole bone of the Breaſt, and reaches to all the Cartilages, even thoſe inoſculated into the Sternon of the true Ribs.<note place="margin">Wherefore the triangular Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle being ſmall in a man, is ſtretched out through the whole bone of the breaſt in a Dog.</note> The reaſon of which difference clearly points at the Divine Providence touching the Fabrick of Animals. For whereas this Animal is born to moſt ſwift and long running, that the blood, while it is more vehemently agitated, may duly be kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and fan'd, as it ought ſwiftly and ſtrongly to draw in the air, even ſo to expire it; (for that freſh air may be more freely ſuckt in, it behoves that all the old be ſtrongly caſt out and exploded) therefore for the ſtronger diſcharge of this exerciſe (of the which little uſe in a man) this Muſcle of a Dog is allotted a great bulk, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to ſuch a work.</p>

And truly ſo it ought to come to paſs, becauſe the air prevailing with an elaſtic force, doth of its own accord readily enter the pulmonary paſſages, as often as they are ſuffered to be open; but from thence that again it may preſently and thorowly be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, there needs a certain force and compreſſion of the parts to thruſt out. For although the inſpiration precede in courſe, yet it is neceſſary that expiration follow immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after, and be proportioned according to the faſhion thereof; for that it may be great, the turns or changes of this being greater are requiſite.

From all this in the firſt place it is clear (which likewiſe in another place we have abundantly declared) that the animal Spirits, for the exerciſing the contractive motion of the muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, leap from the Tendons into the fleſhy Fibres, and afterwards for their relaxation they recede out of theſe into thoſe.

                        <p>It will be needleſs to repeat here what we have already obſerved in another place touching theſe two kinds of motions, <hi>viz.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">The motion of the former ſort ariſeth from the brain, the other from the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellum.</note> that the animal ſpirits of the ſpontaneous moving function are altogether or chiefly diſpenſed from the brain, and the others cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of the meerly natural function are diſpenſed from the <hi>Cerebellum;</hi> moreover alſo as the plenty of both ſorts of ſpirits, ſo the very inſtincts of beginning thoſe actions have their conveyance through the Nerves.</p>
                        <p>Notwithſtanding here ariſeth a doubt, to what kind of moving function, <hi>viz.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">It is a quaere of what kind the actions of breathing are.</note> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpontaneous, or meerly natural, the actions of breathing ought to be referred; alſo of what original, <hi>viz.</hi> whether of the Brain or <hi>Cerebellum,</hi> the animal ſpirits appointed to that employment, are. It is manifeſt enough that this function is in a ſort partaker of a ſpontaneous motion, becauſe it is in our power one while to ſhorten its exerciſes, at other times to prolong, and otherwiſe diverſly to alter them, yea ſometimes a little to reſtrain them. Moreover the nerves belonging to its chief moving Organs, <hi>viz.</hi> the Diaphragma and Muſcles of the breaſt, ſpringing from the nerves of the Arms and Loyns, do owe their deſcent to the Brain, and do plainly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the ſpirits they contain are chiefly ordained for voluntary motions: but moreover on the contrary, this function is ſo far natural, that its organs do reciprocate the conſtant changes of Syſtole and Diaſtole in ſleep, without our notice, and while we wake, we not perceiving it: Moreover although we can for ſome little time ſtop its exerciſe, or at our pleaſure vary it, yet we deny it to be altogether or long ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: beſides, although the nerves appointed to the muſcles of the breaſt and Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragma proceed from the ſpinal nerves, yet theſe latter coming from the branches belonging to the arm communicate in their progreſs with the ſlips of the intercoſtal nerves; moreover, all the other nerves (which belong to the <hi>Cerebellum</hi>) ariſe from theſe, which are ſpread about through the <hi>Trachea</hi> and Lungs.</p>
                        <p>From theſe it plainly follows,<note place="margin">It is concluded to be a mixt act.</note> that the power of breathing is as it were a mixt action, and doth participate of either moving function, <hi>viz.</hi> as well of the ſpontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as natural; and that the ſpirits and nerves of either Province are imployed in this duty, which proceed as well from the brain as from the <hi>Cerebellum;</hi> and truely ſo it ought to come to paſs according to the animal government: for although ſome acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of breathing neceſſary for the preſerving life, ought to be conſtant and perpetual, there are yet many other motions of the breaſt and lungs onely occaſional, and to be perform'd at our pleaſure, as may be diſcerned in laughing, crying, ſinging, hollowing, whiſtling, and other ſingular offices of the lungs and wind-pipe; in which works that they may be done ſtrongly, the muſcles conſpire together, and endeavour joyntly. As in violent labours and exerciſes of the whole body, by which the blood being ſtirred up doth want the greater ventilation, the arms being vehemently moved alſo do force the muſcles of the breaſt, and other pneumonic organs, into more ſpeedy motions for a more frequent breathing. And truly for joint labour of this ſort of the Arms and Diaphragma, the nerves ſerving this motion proceed from the nervous branches of them. Moreover, it is provided for this purpoſe, leſt the exerciſes of the body might enfeeble at any time the ſtrength of the lungs, or exceed the order of breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for when its organs labour more difficultly, or begin to be weary, the nerves of the Diaphragma do warn the other nerves of the arms, plucking them and as it were admoniſhing of their duty to deſiſt from an over intenſe motion.</p>
                        <p>For whereas the function of breathing is ordained for many uſes,<note place="margin">The nerves of the lungs ſome rulers of the natural motion, and others of the voluntary.</note> whereof ſome are merely natural, and others ſpontaneous or violent; therefore the ſpirits and the nerves which proceed and have their government as well from the brain as from the <hi>Cerebellum,</hi> ought to be joyned together, and to afford their ſocial endeavours; yet on that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and as it were by mutual agreement, that one give place to the other by turns for the diſcharging all works chiefly neceſſary, or convenient, and do mutually obey.

Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it may ſeem that theſe little places and empty ſpaces within the Lungs, are certain receptacles of the air (that there may be a larger ſtore of it.) Notwithſtanding it is evidently manifeſt upon experiment frequently made, that the air pufft into the Pipe of the <hi>Trachea</hi> (which is the only entrance into the Lung) doth not enter or blow up theſe interſpaces of the little Lobes:<note place="margin">The interſpaces of the little Lobes have paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage one into the other, and from thence into the Lymphaeducts.</note> notwithſtanding if you blow into the hole of any of theſe interſpaces, immediately all theſe ſpaces pufft up do ſwell in the whole lobe of the Lungs, ſo that all the little lobes diſtinct by great interſpaces, will appear with a pleaſant proſpect; as is expreſſed in the ſecond Figure of the third Table. Moreover the Lymphaeducts creeping through the ſuperficies of the Lungs, ſeem to be every where included in little Membranes covering thoſe interſpaces, and to end in them. But as the lymphatic Veſſels are all furniſhed with little valves, ſo thoſe which appertain to the Lungs are furniſhed with almoſt infinite; as is to be ſeen in the warm large lobe of an Ox, and expreſſed to the life in Tab. 1. d, d, d, d.</p>

                           <hi>SECT. I. CHAP. II.</hi> Of the ſundry kinds of Breathing hurt, and their cauſes, with the accounts of their Symptoms.</head>
                        <p>HItherto we have ſtrictly viewed the Lungs, and the parts any way ſerving their motions, and conſequently the vital function; which being many and different, and the proviſion of the Organs as many very accommodate to breathing; ſo the ſame are many wayes in hazard to be perverted or vitiated, upon ſundry occaſions. Truly a Watch framed with the greateſt artifice with a Spring, with wheels plain and toothed, with chain and ballance, is not more prone or eaſie to be obnoxious to depravation than this Pneumonic machine of the breaſt,<note place="margin">The organs of breathing being hurt, the breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is hurt alſo.</note> through which by ſucking in air we preſerve the vital flame of the blood with its motion and heat. For whereas the veſſels of the lungs belong to the function of breathing, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Trachea,</hi> with the <hi>Bronchii</hi> and little bladders; alſo the heart with arteries and veins, beſides which there are nerves with fibres as well muſculous as nervous, Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheducts and Glandules; alſo the contents of theſe Veſſels, <hi>viz.</hi> Air, the old and freſh blood, with its <hi>Serum,</hi> the Lympha, and the animal Spirits; any fault happening in any of theſe doth oftentimes diſcompoſe the whole Pneumonic function. Nor leſs alſo the moving Organs of the breaſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the muſcles with the Diaphragma, and the nerves appointed to their uſe. And likewiſe ſometimes the animal ſpirits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they enter into thoſe nerves, being ill diſpoſed, often cauſe great diſorders in breathing.</p>
                        <p>When the chief function and uſes of the Lungs have been to convey the blood and air through the whole frames of the parts and their inmoſt receſſes,<note place="margin">The uſes and ends of breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which uſe to be hurt.</note> and every their ſmalleſt paſſages, and every where to mingle them; namely for that purpoſe, that the venal blood returning from its circuit, and diluted with freſh juice, and thereby crude and as it were half extinct, may as well be more perfectly mix'd and wrought together, as more effectually kindled afreſh in all its parts by the nitrous air; from hence the chief faults about this buſineſs or function of the Lungs do moſt of all conſiſt in theſe two things. Firſt, that the blood hath not due paſſage through the <hi>Sinus</hi> of the heart, and the pneumonic veſſels: And ſecondly, becauſe the Air is not drawn in and breathed out in a due manner into the <hi>Trachea</hi> and its paſſages.<note place="margin">The defects and failings of the Lung in its of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</note> There are two parts of either of theſe: For firſt as to the paſſage of the blood, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the fault is caus'd within the right <hi>Sinus</hi> of the heart, or the pneumonic Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and alſo ſometimes cauſed within the pulmonary veins, or the left Ventricle of the heart: Secondly, as to the Air, the failure is chiefly in inſpiring and exſpiring; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though each function offends ſometimes equally. There are divers accidents of each, and many cauſes and ways of its being done, whereof we will here briefly touch upon the chief.</p>

                           <note place="margin">Firſt in respect of the blood.</note>Therefore firſt, when the blood doth not duly paſs through the right Ventricle of the Heart and the Pneumonic Arteries, either it happens by its own fault, or by the fault of thoſe paſſages, and ſometimes by the fault of further paſſages. For ſometimes the ſtream of blood ſtops in the nether region of the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> by reaſon of obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the other; moreover, ſometimes the defect or fault of the air breathed in ſtops the free paſſage of the blood.</p>

The reaſon whereof without doubt is, that then the clear humor flowing from the brain and nervous parts, turns the blood into ſeroſities, and cools it by too much diluting; and for that cauſe the animal ſpirits being deſtitute of their vehicle, either faint or run into irregular motions.</p>

                           <note place="margin">The pneumonic circulation of the blood is ſtopt ſometimes by the fault of the heart it ſelf.</note>But truly as we altogether deny an Elaſtic eſſerveſcence of the blood in the right Ventricle of the Heart from contention of diſſimilar parts; ſo as often as from thence the blood is not caſt out into the Lungs after a due manner, we determine it to happen not ſo much from the proper fault and defect of the blood it ſelf as from the animal faculty. For if the ſpirits actuating the moving Fibres of the Heart, either grow weary, or are forced into convulſive diſorders; for that cauſe the Heart beating in diſorder, drives out before it the blood either infirmly or irregularly.</p>

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40331:123"/> them like a flame of its own accord, but it ſticks ſtill in its paſſages, heavy and muddy, and creates much trouble and labour to the Heart whereſoever it is circulated. Hence as often as the blood is a little more plentifully forced into the <hi>Praecordia</hi> by the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er motion of the whole body, or of its parts, the Heart and Lungs labour hard for its driving about, and that with the utmoſt endeavours. And in this caſe it is probable,<note place="margin">The blood hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in the Lungs ſometimes becauſe not kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled enough;</note> that the blood carried more rapidly into the right Ventricle of the Heart, doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſtagnate; becauſe it cannot preſently be carried into the paſſages obſtructed before it. Moreover from this cauſe thoſe grumous or fleſhy concretions called the <hi>Polypi</hi> of the Heart ſometimes ſeem to ariſe. Hence both in the Pica, Leucophlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, Dropſie, and inveterate Scurvy from the quicker motion of the body ariſes difficult and painful breathing.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Sometimes the blood is too much kindled, and breaking out almoſt into a flame,<note place="margin">Sometimes too much.</note> and being above meaſure expanded, it can ſcarce be contained in the pulmonary paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges (which it very much blows up and extends) but endangers them to be inflamed or kindled; wherefore leſt it ſhould tarry longer in them, the <hi>Praecordia</hi> beat with moſt frequent and ſtrong endeavours, that the blood ſo over-much kindled might be ventila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and circulated: for otherwiſe it being carried within the Lungs, and inflaming them all over, would quickly deſtroy the vital function.</p>
                        <p>Beſides theſe things which concern the kindling of the blood,<note place="margin">It is alſo ſtopt through its tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament being vitiated.</note> there are other faults as to its temperament or mixture, by reaſon of which it leſs freely or expeditely is conveyed through the pneumonic paſſages. For when its conſiſtence is either too laxe or too cloſe, it will not eaſily paſs through the ſmall paſſages of the Lungs; but often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is in hazard to ſtick and ſtagnate in them, and alſo run out and be extravaſated.</p>
                        <p>The blood being in a diverſe manner made looſe in its conſiſtence, either depoſites its Serum, or its dregs, or its putrefaction in the Lungs; which being lodged in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of the Veſſels, or affixed unto their ſides, do variouſly ſtop or pervert the courſe of the blood.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The diſſolution of blood, which is moſt commonly injurious to the Lungs,<note place="margin">When the blood is too much loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened in its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence.</note> (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not very dangerouſly) is wont to happen, for as much as the ſeroſities being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt to be contained within the maſs thereof, and when they are not preſently ſent away by ſweating or urine, they ſeparate from the blood within the Lungs; and ſo boiling up, and breaking out from their proper veſſels, do as well diſturb and ſtop the paſſage of air, as that of blood; ſo that for the ſake of expelling thoſe ſeroſities and continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the circulation of blood, the Lungs are provoked into a frequent and very trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom Cough. What the formal reaſon of this Cough is, and the manner of its being brought about, we ſhall declare hereafter.</p>
                        <p>Though there are many cauſes and occaſions, by which the ſerous liquor,<note place="margin">Why it lodges the Serum in the Lungs.</note> departing from the looſned conſiſtence of the blood, flows out abundantly into the Lungs; yet for the moſt part it happens from one of theſe three, <hi>viz.</hi> firſt and moſt frequently, becauſe the Pores outwardly bound up by cold, caſt back the ſeroſities which were wont to be ſent away by perſpiration, into the maſs of blood; which compel it preſently to boil up, and caſt off the ſerous ſuperfluities in the Lungs.<note place="margin">The various cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and ways of doing it.</note> From this kind of cauſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarrhs and Coughs frequently ariſe, inſomuch that the beginning of every cough by the vulgar is always imputed to ſuch an occaſion, to wit, catching cold. 2. The drinking of ſharp and thin liquors, as Cider, Rheniſh Wine, white Wine, <hi>Paris</hi> Claret common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cauſes to ſome a Cough, or catarrhal diſtemper: the reaſon whereof is, for that the blood, weak in temperament, is preſently diſſolved and precipitated into ſeroſities like milk by ſowre things caſt into it, which flow plentifully from the mouths of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Arteries. I have experimented this upon my ſelf yearly, when in the Summer ſeaſon (when the blood abounds with ſulphur) I have drank Cider and tartiſh Wines ſafely, yea frequently to advantage, the ſame in winter (when the blood is prone to ſowreneſs) but moderately taſted of, do preſently provoke a Cough. 3. There is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe of this ſerous inundation flowing out upon the Lungs, <hi>viz.</hi> when the <hi>Lympha</hi> watering the nervous and ſolid parts, doth ſuddenly ſuffer a flux; and for that cauſe it ſtreams back into the blood out of the Fibres and Glandules, and other paſſages and receptacles; whoſe liquor it preſently diſſolves, and precipitates into ſeroſities, which often infeſts the Lungs.</p>
                        <p>For this reaſon a ſudden and troubleſom Cough frequently accompanies convulſive diſtempers, which being commonly called a vaporous Cough is aſcribed unto vapours. Moreover in great alterations of air, eſpecially when the ſeaſon varies from dry into moiſt, and the volatile and fixed ſalts do thereby melt, the Cough and Catarrhs increaſe very much.</p>
                        <pb n="20" facs="tcp:40331:124"/>
                        <p>Neither doth the ſerous liquor only, but alſo many other humors or recrements of the blood lodged in the Lungs frequently ſtuff up their paſſages; ſo that by obſtructing both the paſſages of air and of blood, they cauſe difficult breathing or a cough. This is every where perceived in ill-habited bodies, alſo in Gluttons and Drunkards, and others leading an inordinate and ſlothful life. Wherefore Foot-men uſe a thin and ſpare diet, that they may have their Lungs free from the filth and recrements of the blood. I have obſerved ſome melancholy perſons, the aduſt <hi>faeces</hi> abounding in the pulmonary paſſages, to have voided blackiſh ſpittle like ink; alſo others cholerick, and inclining to the Jaundice to void yellow, and ſometimes very bitter, as if it had been meer choler.</p>

Moreover many inſtances manifeſtly declare, that ſometimes the Lungs are taint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the corruption and putrefaction of the blood. For the blood, toucht with an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or a peſtilent or venemous contagion, begins to be corrupted, and withdraw into clotted and corrupted portions; from thence the Lungs undergo the chief taint, from whence the greateſt danger of life is threatned. This is too well known in the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſles, ſmall Pox, Plague, and malignant Feavers, for me now to undertake to explicate it: by which maladies as often as the ſick die, it ſeems to come to paſs, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the blood clodding in the veſſels of the Heart or Lungs, obſtructs the way of its proper courſe, ſo that preſently its influx into the Brain is hindred, or becauſe the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rruption of the blood, affixt to the ſides of the pulmonary paſſages, cauſes a Phlegmon as it were; and therefore provokes a moſt troubleſom cough or difficult breathing, and frequently bloody ſpittle. So much for the impediments of the circulation of the blood, which happen in the Lungs by reaſon of the maſs of blood too much diſſolved, and apt to depart into parts and portions,<note place="margin">The blood is hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in the Lungs by reaſon of the too thick conſiſtence of the blood;</note> (which being there left obſtruct their paſſages.)

By what means and for what cauſe the Heart offending in its motion, forces the blood from its right ventricle through the Lungs into the left irregularly, we have clearly ſhewn in our late Tract of Cardiac Diſtempers: to wit, that muſcle ſometimes labouring for want of ſpirits doth not vigorouſly and ſtrongly enough perform its beatings.<note place="margin">

Thus I have obſerved in Virgins af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with the Green-ſickneſs, and in other cachectical bodies, from a quick motion of

                              <hi>3.</hi> The blood is hindred from obſtruction of the paſſages.

Of the former there are two reaſons, <hi>viz.</hi> ſometimes the ways are ſhut, for as much as the paſſages of the veſſels, contracted by the carneous fibres, are brought nearer one another; as we have elſewhere ſhewed, doth ſometimes happen in Palpitation of the Heart, and a convulſive Aſthma. The affects of which ſort, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the ſtream of blood ſhut within the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> difficult or hard breathing, a ſmall Pulſe, and chilneſs of the whole body are wont to accompany. Moreover ſometimes the courſe of the blood is ſhut up, becauſe the paſſages of the veſſels are preſſed together by a body, or by ſome humor from without: wherefore when the little Cells or bronchial Pipes (as is uſual) are filled with a viſcous flegm, purulent matter, or blood extravaſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as the free paſſage of the air is hindred in them, ſo alſo the paſſage of blood is ſtopt in the veſſels adjoining. On the ſame account come tumors, little ſwellings, worms, alſo ſtony, ſandy, and curdly concretions, and others of another kind are in diverſe manners excited; the chief whereof we ſhall touch on hereafter.<note place="margin">The bronchial Pipes are filled.</note> Moreover we ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſee the canals as well of an Artery as of the pneumonic Vein, made very bony in ſome part, and their ſides ſo compreſſed, that a very ſmall chink remains for the blood to paſs. Not long ſince we diſſected a young man who died by reaſon of an ill forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the pneumonic Vein,<note place="margin">Sometimes wax hard.</note> in whom the trunk of this veſſel growing ſtony near the juncture to the heart, did ſtick ſo cloſe, that the blood did drop into the heart only by drops, or by a very little ſtream. 2.

We have known ſome to have died Aſthmatic or ſhort-winded, whoſe Lungs being free from an Ulcer, or any more grievous wound, have ſwelled ſo much, that they wanted room for their motion within the cavity of the Cheſt: the reaſon whereof doubtleſs was, that the thicker and more feculent blood, for that cauſe not eaſily paſſing through thoſe veſſels, every where extended the Arteries and Veins, and cauſed it to ſtagnate in the leſſer Pipes. Moreover the feculencies of blood one while ſalt of different kinds, another while ſulphureous or earthly being combined with them, and thruſt into the ſmall paſſages of the veſſels, and fixed there, do altogether obſtruct them; inſomuch that the pneumonic circulation of the blood is contracted into a ſhorter ſpace, and conſequently the function of breathing is ſtraitned in the compreſſed Pipes or little Cells. There are many kinds and ſundry ways of ſuch an obſtruction, which if all or the chief ſhould be enumerated, ſuch a Pathology would ſwell into a too great bulk. 3. The pneumonic paſſage of blood is not only hindred by reaſon of the paſſages ſhut and obſtructed, but ſometimes alſo being burſt aſunder. For thoſe veſſels being ſmall,<note place="margin">The blood is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo hindred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are burſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder, as in spitting blood.</note> or tender, or very looſe in ſome perſons, are frequently opened by the force or acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of blood; ſo that the blood either burſting into the <hi>Trachea,</hi> is ejected by ſpitting, or heaped up in the interſpaces of the paſſages, cauſes a Peripneumony, or falling down into the cavity of the Cheſt, produces an Empyema. Of all theſe we ſhall treat ſingly in the Chapter of ſpitting of blood.</p>

There remains as yet a third impediment of blood in the pneumonic paſſages, which happens for the want or fault of Air. If at any time the Blood is not kindled after a due manner within the paſſages of the Lungs, from air breathed in by the <hi>Trachea;</hi> for that cauſe as preſently its flame is irregular, ſo likewiſe its motion is variouſly ſtopt or perverted: for although the blood is forced through the lungs by the meer impulſe of the heart, notwithſtanding the pulſe hereof is proportioned according to the tenour of its being kindled by the air; wherefore when the flame of blood is diminiſhed, or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt, for want or through the fault of the air, preſently the pulſe proves languid or unequal, and by reaſon of the bloods courſe being troubled, or ſtopt, preſently a paleneſs and coldneſs ſucceeds throughout the whole body, with enervation of the members. But if inſpiration be wholly intercepted or fruſtrated (becauſe the nitrous particles are wanting) preſently the pulſe ceaſes, and anon life is loſt. The reaſon of all which is, both becauſe the blood being much impeded in its accenſion, or extinct, like Muſt given over working preſently ſubſides, and is unapt for any motion; and chiefly becauſe the flame of the blood failing, and being ſubſtracted from the brain, preſently the Hypoſtaſis of the animal ſpirits, as it were light ſtreaming from thence, immediately fails, and together with it the exerciſe or actions of all faculties do ceaſe. But if the blood is too much kindled, the Sulphur of the Blood, and the Nitre of the Air running together more than it ought; for that cauſe preſently, that this too much burning may be eventilated enough, the pulſe of the heart is increaſed to its utmoſt. We might adde many inſtances of this kind; but truely this conſideration of the blood leads us to the ſecond thing propoſed of Reſpiration hurt; namely that we may duely weigh, what ſort of failings or defects do happen about the inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as well as expiration of the Nitrous air, requiſite for the preſerving the nitral flame of blood; that is to ſay, from what cauſes they proceed, and alſo what effects they are wont to produce; in which ſearch we will firſt treat of Inſpiration hurt.</p>

As to the former, if the Air chance to be depraved, it neither duely kindles nor eventilates the blood, yea it ſometimes overthrows the temperament there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, or infects it, as is every where ſeen in a Conſtitution of Air very malignant. That we may touch on the chief reaſons of theſe diſtempers,<note place="margin">The faults of the air.</note> we are to obſerve, That as the Nitrous particles of Air are chiefly neceſſary, (as is manifeſt by manifold experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) for the preſervation of life; ſo frequently it happens that Nitre of the Air either to ſail or be wholly wanting, or by particles of another kind to be ſo much muffled, or bound up, that they cannot enough exerciſe their vital power; or laſtly, malignant or fatal Corpuſcles to be adjoyned thereunto. Firſt, the nitrous particles of Air are deficient, if when it ſtagnating or growing hot the Nitre is chaſed thence, or not ſtirr'd into action. Wherefore, in a low-rooft Chamber, or too cloſe, and in other places crouded with aſſemblies of men, or made hot with the ardor of the Sun, we difficultly or weakly breathe. The ſame comes to paſs in places of great height, on the tops of thoſe mountains exceeding the top of the <hi>Atmoſphere;</hi> wherein breath is faintly drawn for want of Nitre, neither can we live long there. Secondly, the Nitrous particles of Air are wont to be obſcured or blunted by other acceſſories, alſo ſometimes they are too much ſharpened. For as often as the South-wind blows, the Air is too moiſt and thick, inaſmuch as the Nitrous particles are ſeiz'd upon by the watry and ſulphureous, and are much blunted, ſo that while it is drawn in, the blood is not vigorouſly kindled, but like green wood put into fire it rather ſmokes than burns bright; wherefore during ſuch a ſtate of Air we become ſtupid and dull, and unapt for motion; but on the contrary, the North-wind blowing, the cooling, ſharp and moſt nipping particles are adjoined to the Nitrous, and the blood is enough kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled, and we breathe freely; yet the Vital flame is every where reſtrain'd by intenſe froſt diſproportion'd thereunto, and unleſs refreſh'd by motion and heat, it is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently entirely extinguiſhed.</p>

                           <pb n="23" facs="tcp:40331:125"/>2. Beſides theſe faults of the Air, whereby breathing is wont to be hurt,<note place="margin">The defect of air hurting breathing, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the pneumonic Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans.</note> more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over this evil ſometimes proceeds from its defect; inaſmuch as it cannot be drawn in in plenty enough. Of which effects though there are many and divers cauſes, yet for the moſt part it happens in reſpect of the organs of breathing, either hindred as to their motion, or their paſſages obſtructed.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The Organs of breathing are either meerly paſſive, <hi>viz.</hi> which are moved, as the Lungs; or are Active, and move themſelves, and thoſe together, as the muſcles of the Cheſt and Diaphragma. In every of theſe the impediments of the motion by which breathing is hurt, happen variouſly. And firſt what reſpects the Lungs, we mentioned before, that they ſometimes very much ſwell, by reaſon of the veſſels being much diſtended, and fill'd with blood, inſomuch as being ſtiffe and inflexible, they obey not the turns of the Syſtole and Diaſtole of the Cheſt. Moreover it happens ſometimes through a phlegmon, little ſwellings, and other concretions of divers forms, that a like ſtiffeneſs is cauſed in them. Secondly, the active organs of breathing, or the moving parts, <hi>viz.</hi> the muſcles of the Cheſt and Diaphragma are wont to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted or ſtopt from their moving function by divers cauſes. A ſolution of continuity made in any part of theſe, either by clotting of blood, or by falling down of the <hi>Serum,</hi> and other humors, as in the Pleuriſie and Scurvy, or in thoſe that are wounded or bruiſed, doth every where cauſe pain in the place affected, with impotency of moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and difficult breathing. Moreover, ſometimes without pain, or any evident cauſe, thoſe parts being hindred from their motion do produce a moſt heavy purſineſs; As is frequently ſeen in an Aſthma, Suffocation of the womb, and in certain other convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive or hypochondriac diſtempers. The reaſon of which paſſion without doubt conſiſts in this, for that the animal ſpirits appointed to the moving function of thoſe parts, are diſturbed about their Origine, or hindered in the paſſages of the Nerves, and are turned aſide from their due influx into the moving fibres: Inſomuch as many who are found enough as to their Lungs, and only obnoxious to affects of the Brain and Nerves, are frequently ſurprized with horrid fits of an Aſthma, as we have at large declared in another place.</p>

The ſtopping of air, hindering breathing, whereby it leſs freely enters the Lungs, frequently happens, by reaſon of the Conveyances, <hi>viz.</hi> the paſſages of the <hi>Trachea</hi> being ſhut, or not enough open. For indeed thoſe paſſages are wont to be ſtopt (as we have formerly obſerved touching the Veſſels bringing Blood) and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit the full entrance of air, when they are either obſtructed or compreſſed, or more narrowly contracted.<note place="margin">The various ways of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions.</note> Though there are many cauſes and wayes whereby the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of the <hi>Trachea</hi> are wont to be obſtructed, yet chiefly and moſt often a Catarrhal diſtillation of the <hi>Serum,</hi> while it departs from the blood, and flows out of the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels bringing blood into theſe parts; which being firſt thin and ſharp, produces a troubleſome Cough; afterwards thickening by digeſtion, and cleaving to the ſides of the <hi>Trachea,</hi> exceedingly ſtraitens the ways of inſpiration,<note place="margin">A Catarrh.</note> and ſhortens them by quite ſtuffing up their extremities. In like manner the ſweating out of extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſated blood, as alſo of <hi>Pus</hi> or ichorous matter out of the Lympheducts or Veins into the tracheal little bladders, doth frequently produce an Aſthma, and often a Conſumption; the reaſon of which ſort of diſtempers ſhall be more largely explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hereafter. Secondly, it is manifeſt enough by common obſervation, that the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheal paſſages as well the laſt as the intermedial, often-times are ſtraitened, or ſhut,<note place="margin">The ſwelling of blood by which the paſſages are preſs'd together.</note> by compreſſion. For after a plentiful meal, or abundant drinking of Wine or ſtrong Ale (inaſmuch as the pneumonic veſſels are very much diſtended by reaſon of the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency of blood, and the ſides of the Trachea being preſs'd together, do not admit of a free and uſual entrance of air) men otherwiſe healthful enough, do breathe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultly and painfully: Which truely we eſteem to happen from the lungs being filled and extended rather, than from a cram'd ſtomach hindering the Syſtole of the Diaphragma. Moreover, for this reaſon, even in the very paroxyſmes of feavers a frequent and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full breathing is manifeſt. Neither onely from the turgency of blood, but alſo from the ſame ſtagnating, or extravaſated, and alſo from ſtony concretions, and divers other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, the veſſels of the Trachea being preſſed together, cannot diſcharge a free breathing.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The paſſages of the Trachea being ſometimes more nearly contracted and cloſed from their fibres convulſively diſpoſed,<note place="margin">The Cramps of the tracheal paſſages.</note> deny a paſſage to the Air for due breathing. From hence, when there is no obſtruction, or ill conformation in the lungs, as alſo no conſumptive diſpoſition, yet from thoſe fibres preternaturally convulſed and drawn together, dreadfull fits of an Aſthma frequently ariſe. Whereas we have in another
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40331:126"/> place diſcourſed of theſe paſſions, it will not be requiſite here again to repeat that diſcourſe. Beſides theſe accidents of breathing hurt, there are certain others which are ſtirr'd up by reaſon of the Air prohibited in its firſt entrance, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Noſtrils, the throat, the <hi>Larynx,</hi> from a tumour or ill conformation: For the <hi>Polypus</hi> in the Noſe, the Quinzy in the Throat, or inflammation of the Tonſils, do render a difficult breathing; in the ſame manner as a heap of ſand about a Haven, obſtructs the ingreſs and regreſs of Ships. But truly ſince the reaſons of thoſe paſſions, and their manner of being made, are expoſed to ſenſe, it ſeems ſuperfluous here to deliver their cauſes.</p>

For while the muſcles ſtraiten the cavity of the breaſt, and every where ſqueeze the whole lungs; theſe fibres one while contracting theſe tracheal paſſages, another while them, cloſing behind the air while it is driven forwards, do endeavour its expulſion more quick and vehement.</p>
                        <pb n="25" facs="tcp:40331:126"/>
                        <p>A more intenſe ſudden inſpiration precedes every act of a Cough, to wit that the air being admitted in greater plenty, may preſently be more violently driven out with noiſe; in which endeavour not onely the new that is freſh breathed in, but alſo the old, being heaped up before in the tracheal little bladders, is driven forth together with a noiſe, for the encreaſe of breath blown out; and when what is troubleſome is not ſettled nor removed at the firſt aſſault, the vehement exſpiration of this kind is repeated by a frequent courſe, even to the great wearying of Nature.</p>
                        <p>The firſt cauſe of every Cough is an irritation of the nerves or fibres belonging to the lungs; concerning the nerves we are to obſerve,<note place="margin">Its primary cauſe.</note> that not onely the branches and their ſlips inſerted into the Lungs, but others from which they do ariſe, or with which they do intimately communicate, being provok'd in places far diſtant from the breaſt, immediately cauſe a cough: for which cauſe oftentimes a ſharp humour being lodged within the Brain, and from thence falling down into the little head of the pectoral nerves, is wont to produce a moſt troubleſome Cough or Aſthmatick diſtempers, as not long ſince we have declared by notable inſtances. For the ſame reaſon a pain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on the noſtrils, palate, or <hi>Gula,</hi> provokes a Cough, or rather a vain attempt of coughing. Moreover a little <hi>Serum</hi> diſtilling from the Arteries into the upper parts of the <hi>Gula</hi> or <hi>Larynx</hi> produces a frequent and very troubleſome Cough, without any notable prejudice of the Lungs. But truly this provocation, inflicted on the nerves and fibres diſtributed in the Lung it ſelf, more frequently, and truly more violently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes an endeavour of Coughing, which is repeated by courſes, till what is trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome be turned forth, or the provocation reſtrained. Of this kind of Cough from the nerves, a notable Example ſhall be after ſet before you.</p>
                        <p>The provoking cauſes producing a Cough are manifold,<note place="margin">The evident cauſes thereof.</note> and make their ſtay in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places: for beſides that the nerves, as we but now intimated, and alſo the membranes, with which there is an intimate communication with the Lungs, being provoked in the open Noſtril, give an impreſſion of that paſſion at a diſtance to the Lungs; moſt frequently that irregular exſpiration is ſtirr'd up, by reaſon ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous or in ſome meaſure unproportion'd thing is caſt into the Lungs. For in the firſt place, that this troubleſome thing may be removed, the nerves and the nervous fibres diſperſed about the Lungs are irritated; afterwards by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of theſe, the muſcles of the breaſt that draw it together, and the moving fibres of the Trachea at once are forced into vehement and often repeated con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions.</p>
                        <p>Every Cough is either moiſt or dry;<note place="margin">The kinds thereof.</note> in the former a certain humour being depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited in ſome place within the tracheal paſſages is ſhaked by coughing, and being to be thrown out upwards is caſt into the mouth. That humour, whereas it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold and after divers ſorts, for the moſt part it is either call'd ſerous, or nutritious, or purulent, or bloody.</p>
                        <p>Of the former there are many kinds and differences; namely, as to its conſiſtence it is either thin, or thick, or crude, or digeſted; as to its colour, it is either white or yellow, or ſomewhat greeniſh; alſo ſometimes it is blewiſh, or black. Moreover,<note place="margin">A moiſt Cough.</note> a moiſt Cough is variouſly diſtinguiſhed, as to the places from whence the humour to be coughed out proceeds. For ſometimes cleaving to the ſides of the <hi>Larynx,</hi> or ſweating from them, the moving fibres being ſhaken by a gentle little Cough, it is eaſily and by a ſhort paſſage caſt forth into the mouth; ſometimes the matter to be excerned, being impacted a little deeper in the pipes of the <hi>Bronchii,</hi> is not ſhook out but by large expirations, and often repeated; and laſtly it ſometimes happens, that the excrements to be caſt out, are depoſited within the fartheſt little bladders of the Trachea, out of which it is not brought forth without a vehement labour of coughing, and that frequently repeated, and at laſt driven forth by a long journey through the whole lungs. Concerning the Cough of a nutritious humour, as alſo of a bloody and purulent, hereafter it ſhall be diſcourſed when we treat of a Conſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and its remedy.</p>
                        <p>A dry Cough, as often as it is the proper paſſion of the Lungs,<note place="margin">A dry Cough.</note> is excited after many manners and by ſundry cauſes; for an obſtruction of any of the pneumonic paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, whether it be by compreſſion, or oppletion, or contraction, doth neceſſarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce this. Wherefore an inflammation, a tumour, a little ſwelling, a ſtagnation of the blood either through plenty or ſcarcity, alſo gravelly, ſtony, or polypoſe Concretions, worms and many other preternatural things, inaſmuch as they almoſt perpetually provoke the nervous fibres, do induce a dry, vain Cough, but very troubleſome. But
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40331:127"/> a dry Cough ſometimes is ſtirr'd up by the inſtinct of Nature, as in place of a Pump; to wit, that the blood either by reaſon of its proper ill temperament, or by reaſon of the pneumonic Veſſels not being open enough, not paſſing well through the lungs, may be promoted by the ſhaking of theſe parts, and forced into a more rapid mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>What belongs unto the other acts of expiration hurt, as when in ſneezing, hiccough, laughing, crying, and in other affects its natural and even function is troubled or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted; ſeeing the rendrings of the cauſes of theſe (which alſo in another place we have in part deſigned) do not properly appertain to our purpoſe, omitting them here we will paſs to the thing chiefly deſigned, <hi>viz.</hi> to the diſeaſes of the breaſt and their remedies, and to the reaſons of curing them.</p>

For truly the Conſumption of the Lungs it ſelf doth not next and immediately proceed from an Ulcer or corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of that bowel; but it ariſes for as much as the blood from them contracting a corruption, and highly defiled, for that very cauſe loſes altogether its nutritive virtue. Moreover as well this as the nervous liquor acquires ſuch an indiſpoſition. Of which in general we will now inquire.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">An Atrophy firſt depends on the blood made unfit to nouriſh.</note>And firſt what relates to the Blood, we may often take notice, that ſome pine away without a Cough, or without any apparent fault either in the Lungs or Breaſt; in the mean time as to appetite, digeſtion, ſleep, and almoſt the oeconomy of the whole natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and animal function do carry themſelves indifferent; notwithſtanding, as if nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment ſhould be poured into a Receptable bored through, they are not nouriſhed, but pine away ſenſibly maugre all Dietetical Rules. The formal or conjunct reaſon of which kind of affect frequently conſiſts only in this, that the blood being notably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved, cannot aſſimilate the nouriſhing juice continually mixt with it; wherefore it doth not only forthwith ſend it away, but alſo takes away ſome particles of the ſolid parts; which ſnatching to it ſelf, it preſently throws out, or caſts it into ſome place or other, or conſumes it by evaporation.</p>
                        <p>The depravations or degenerate ſtates of the blood, that are wont to induce an Atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, either conſiſt in its proper diſtemper, or themſelves are communicated from ſome other place, and indeed chiefly from the bowels, or from the nervous liquor being alſo degenerate.</p>
                        <pb n="27" facs="tcp:40331:127"/>
                        <p>The proper Dyſcraſie of the blood it ſelf is twofold, according to which it happens,<note place="margin">The conſumptive Dyſcraſie of the blood either from it ſelf or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated from other parts.</note> that the ſaline-acid particles or the ſulphureous and moſt ſharp are exalted above mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and predominate over the reſt. For ſometimes the blood withdraws it ſelf from its genuine diſpoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> a ſweet and volatile into an acid, as is always found in ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butical, melancholy, or cachectical perſons. Wherefore the nutritious juice being ever mingled with the bloody maſs, ſeeing it cannot for that reaſon be aſſimilated, and affix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſolid parts, is releaſed again in a ſhort time; and is either forthwith ſent away by urine, ſweat, or a Diarrhoea; or being pen'd up within the fleſh or cavities of the bowels, brings a Dropſie: of which ſort of diſtempers, being led forth into an evil ſtate,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>1.</hi> The kinds of the former are reckoned up.</note> the ordinary effect is wont to be, that when ſome parts do ſwell very much, other parts are very much extenuated. Here it would be far from our purpoſe to deliver the true cauſe of the above-mentioned affects, and to put our ſickle not only into another mans harveſt, but alſo one far remote. 2. Moreover there is another ſtate of blood unfit for nouriſhment quite contrary to this, to wit, when being above meaſure hot and ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous, and from thence always violently burning out, it conſumes the nutritious juice by its efferveſcence and raging, and cauſes it too much to evaporate; ſo that the ſolid parts being defrauded of their proviſion pine away. The perſons obnoxious to this diſtemper have large veſſels, and much diſtended with blood, but their fleſh withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and hardned by heat. Though perſons ſo affected ſeldom pine away to death, yet they grow old ſooner, and end their life in a ſhorter ſpace.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The blood not only from its proper <hi>indoles,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">This proceeds ſometimes from a fault of the bowels or ſolid parts;</note> but alſo by reaſon of a Conſumption elſewhere, and chiefly communicated from the bowels and nervous juice, is often unfit to nouriſh. And firſt this frequently happens by fault of the bowels; for theſe being ill-affected, ſometimes do not duly digeſt the Chyme to be conveyed over to the blood; alſo oftentimes they pervert and defile it with their extraneous and heterogene fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, inſomuch that the functions are fruſtrated in the faculties of breeding good blood and nouriſhment. Moreover ſometimes by reaſon of the Veſſels bringing the Chyle obſtructed within them, though much be eaten, yet little or leſs than due, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed into the bloody maſs. Alſo in the bowels of concoction ſometimes Tumors, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſthumes, and Ulcers happen; from whoſe corruption the blood being infected in its paſſage, contaminates the reſt of the maſs, and renders it unapt to the work of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing. How often do we ſee from a Schirrus happening in the Spleen, Liver, Pancreas, or Meſentery, or by an Ulcer or cancrous Tumour of ſome Gut, as alſo of a Kidney, Womb, or Bladder, or otherwiſe malignant Sore, a deadly Atrophy to have ſucceeded without any notable fault of the Breaſt or Lungs? Yea Tumors, Impoſthumes, or cancrous and ſtrumous Ulcers happening in the outward parts, and eſpecially in the Back, do frequently end in a pernicious Conſumption. The reaſon whereof is plain, <hi>viz.</hi> in as much as in ſuch diſtempers both great plenty of the nutritious juice brought to the affected part through the Arteries, is either entirely beſtowed in the ſame place, or from thence is poured forth abroad, inſomuch that all the other parts of the whole body are defrauded of their due proviſion; as alſo that the virulent or very incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous matter there engendered and lodged is ſwallowed up by again the Veins, which defiles the blood by an impure black gore, and from thence renders it altogether unapt to diſcharge the faculty of nouriſhing.</p>
                        <p>Neither only from the bowels and ſolid parts,<note place="margin">Or from the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous juice.</note> but alſo from the nervous juice the ſtain (by which it becomes unfit to nouriſh) is frequently communicated to the blood. For when this liquor degenerates from its genuine temper, to wit, ſweet and volatile into an acid, preſently flowing out of the fibres and nervous parts, and flowing back into the blood, it doth precipitate the liquor thereof, and compels it into fluxes, whereby all the nutritive matter is caſt forth, and one while poured forth by Urine or Sweat, another while by Vomit or Looſneſs. The reaſons of all theſe, and how they come to paſs we have explicated in a late Treatiſe.</p>
                        <p>But the nervous liquor, ſometimes by it ſelf, departing from its good temper,<note place="margin">The nervous juice ſometimes of it ſelf is chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the cauſe of an Atrophy.</note> and being vitiated in its temperament, is a cauſe of want of nouriſhment, which alſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to be made in a twofold reſpect, or two manner of ways. For ſometimes that Juice being very much vitiated and degenerate, proves as it were vappid and decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſo that it doth not actuate enough the fibres as well nervous as carnous, and inlighten them with an animal ſpirit: wherefore as the motive virtue, ſo alſo the nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive fails in the ſolid parts. From hence either the entire body, or certain members and parts thereof being for ſome while affected with a Palſie, at length they wither away: as we have at large declared the reaſon thereof in another place. 2. We have

                           <note place="margin">Two kinds.</note>
                           <hi>Tabes Dorſalis,</hi> although it hath almoſt loſt its name in this our Age, or perhaps changed it into a Gonorrhoea, yet <hi>Hippocrates</hi> makes mention of it, and handling it avowedly,<note place="margin">From the nervous juice ſtopt or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved in the loyns.</note> he aſſigned a twofold kind thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> one from immoderate Venery, and the other from a deſtillation into the Spine of the Back. What relates to the latter, I have often obſerved ſome to be moſt grievouſly vexed with a pain about their Loyns, yea ſometimes in the whole Back, which when for ſome time ſome have ſo laboured under, they afterwards come to be lame or crooked, and at laſt fall away in the whole body, all but the head. The cauſe of which diſeaſe doubtleſs conſiſts in this, <hi>viz.</hi> firſt a humour or a certain incongruous morbific matter, deſcending with the nervous juice through the ſpinal marrow, did run into the branches of the vertebral Nerves, and therefore from the beginning, by reaſon of the Fibres being twitched, a continual pain almoſt did ariſe; afterwards by reaſon of ſome Fibres being reſolved, the oppoſite ones more vehemently contracted diſtort certain Vertebra's of the Spine; and laſtly ſeeing the animal Spirits cannot actuate enough the Nerves and Fibres belonging to the trunk and members, by reaſon of the nouriſhment fruſtrated, the withering of the entire body ſucceeds. Surely when the nervous liquor and animal ſpirits paſs not fully and freely out of the Dorſal Spine into the whole body, from thence oftentimes a pining doth ariſe: hence Impoſthumes and Ulcers ariſe about the Loins or the <hi>Os ſacrum,</hi> which in as much as they conſume or pour forth the nervous liquor too much, cauſe an Atrophy in the whole, or at leaſt in the lower parts.</p>

Another kind of <hi>Tabes Dorſalis</hi> far more frequent, is alſo twofold: <hi>viz.</hi> it either ariſeth from the great or too often loſs of the genital humor, or from a continual cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt flux from the genital parts.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. As to the firſt, it is manifeſt by vulgar obſervation, that the immoderate uſe of Venery, yea involuntary efflux of the ſeed, if it be either great or continual, produce a faintneſs in the whole body, and at length a pining away. The reaſon of this (as we have intimated in another place) is not, that the ſeed, according to the opinion of ſome, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends from the Brain through the Nerves into the ſpermatic bodies, and from thence, by reaſon of a great loſs thereof firſt the Brain, and then the parts, all depending on the influence of the Spirits ſpringing from thence, become infirm and pine away. But ſeeing we have ſufficiently evinced, that the ſeminal matter is immediately ſupplied out of the maſs of blood into the genital parts, and that it is altogether the ſame with that out of which the animal Spirits inſtilled into the Brain are procreated, it will neceſſarily follow, by how much the greater portion is got to the Teſticles for repairing the loſs of ſeed, by ſo much is the Brain defrauded of its due ſhare, and therefore at length the function in the whole body, as well motive as nutritive, doth waver and diminiſh. Our furious Whoremongers are ſenſible of a great debility about their Loins, and the parts placed below them, to wit, the Thighs and Legs, do chiefly wither away; the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe as well the proviſion of the animal Spirits in its firſt ſpring, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Brain failing, the outmoſt chanels, <hi>viz.</hi> the ends of the ſpinal marrow, and the Nerves ſpringing from it, do ſuffer firſt and chiefly for this defect; and moreover becauſe near the Loins the arterious blood gives out to the Teſticles more excellent particles and chiefly reſtaurative, being deſtined to nouriſh the Back, and in the mean time the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous blood being for that cauſe decayed or conſumed, is enfeebled, and ſteals from the Loins as much as poſſibly may be.</p>

                        <p>The loſs of the ſeed cauſing a Conſumption is ſometimes voluntary,<note place="margin">The loſſes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary or involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary.</note> of which ſort the ſalacious and prone to Venery do ſuffer: ſometimes involuntary; of which affects there are divers kinds. For in ſome it only happens by dreams or obſcene phantaſms; but in others, beſides thoſe occaſions, every endeavour of the Back, whether through bearing a weight, or excretion of Urine, or the <hi>faeces</hi> of the Belly, cauſes the genital humor to be thruſt out: the cauſe whereof is, both becauſe the ſeed is watry and thin and at once ſharp and provocative, alſo becauſe the parts are weak, and not able duly to digeſt or retain it.</p>
                        <p>In the other <hi>Tabes Dorſalis</hi> above-mentioned, not the ſeed it ſelf,<note place="margin">

For near the ſpermatic Veſſels, or in paſſage from them, as well in men as women, there are certain Emunctories placed, whoſe faculty is to receive the ſuperfluous humour from the ſeed formed, and when it abounds to ſend it abroad through the genital parts. For this cauſe that thoſe paſſages in either Sex may be made ſlippery and moiſt (leſt they grow dry,<note place="margin">The formal rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a virulent Gonorrhea.</note> and become leſs ſenſible) the Proſtates in men and the Glandules about the horns of the womb in women are conſtituted; out of both which always in the act of coition, and ſometimes without, when the ſpermatic bodies abound with too much moiſture, a certain ſerous liquor ſweats out: and in wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (whoſe bodies are more moiſt, and in whom Nature hath made theſe ways for their menſtrual excretion) this doth oftner and more plentifully happen than to men. But if theſe Emunctories be affected with a great debility, or a certain virulency, ſo that they corrupt this liquor ſent, or do not retain it enough, it is not only ſent away in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly, and flows out plentifully through the <hi>Pudendum,</hi> but alſo other ſuperfluous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours or recrements of the whole body flowing together to thoſe weak parts are thrown forth together. Alſo the nutritious Juice deſtined to the neighbouring parts flows thither, and preſently goes out together; ſo that at length by reaſon of the loſs of the nutritious Juice (which flowing to the ſame place is corrupted and continually ſent away) not only pains of the neighbouring parts, but of the whole body, and a pining doth ſucceed. Theſe things are commonly known in a Gonorrhoea, alſo in <hi>fluore mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liebri,</hi> or thoſe affects from an impure bed, or immoderate Venery, or are cauſed by a blow, a bruiſe, violent exerciſe, or any other hurt inflicted upon the Loins.

For in the Lungs rather than in the Heart or Brain, the threads of life are ſpun, and there they are oftneſt defiled or broken.</p>

                           <note place="margin">The cauſe aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents.</note>The Ancients following <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> for the moſt part have aſſigned only two cauſes of this diſeaſe, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Catarrh,</hi> and <hi>the breaking of a Vein,</hi> to which ſome have added an <hi>Empyema:</hi> and others exclude a Catarrh from this number: for what is vulgarly affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that flegm falling from the Head into the Lungs, and abiding there putrifies, is moſt commonly the cauſe of a Phthiſis, or is often brought by it, we have formerly intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be altogether erroneous, and ſhall preſently ſhew it more clearly. In the mean time to ſhew what the matter is that generates a Conſumption as often as it ariſes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Empyema or Haemoptoe going before,<note place="margin">What the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive matter is.</note> it muſt be conſidered after how many manners and by what ways any thing diſagreeable or heterogene can enter into the Lungs; which diligent ſearch being made, it will eaſily appear, that any thing that is an enemy to the Lungs creeps in and is admitted chiefly either by the <hi>Trachea</hi> or by the pneumonic Arteries,<note place="margin">By what ways it enters the Lungs.</note> yea and ſometimes haply by the Nerves, but nothing by the Veins or Lymphaeducts, whoſe function is only to carry back or away the blood or Lympha, and to leave there nothing at all.</p>
                        <p>As to the <hi>Trachea,</hi> it is manifeſt it is ordained for this end, that by its paſſages or pipes the air might be conveyed in or preſently carried back by a conſtant recourſe from whence it comes;<note place="margin">Sometimes by the Trachea, yet not deſtilling from the head.</note> moreover, whether any matter being hurtful or mortal to the <hi>Praecordia</hi> may be admitted the ſame way, ſhall be now our preſent diſquiſition. And that the Lungs frequently incur a pernicious pollution by this entrance is clear from hence, becauſe the moiſt air of ſome regions, repleat with fumes, or abounding with malignant vapours, doth frequently induce the conſumptive inclination; nevertheleſs the affection thereof is wont to be communicated only by aerial minute particles (whereby either the temperament of the blood or the conformation of the Lungs or both are prejudiced.) But whether beſides this a ſerous matter or ſome humor corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lungs doth enter them through this paſſage, is not without reaſon doubted: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though many do determine a Catarrh or a deſtillation of the Serum from the Brain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lungs by the paſſages of the <hi>Trachea,</hi> the principal cauſe of a Phthiſis. Which opinion being erroneouſly delivered by the Ancients, I admire any either of our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Phyſicians or Philoſophers have admitted thereof; for it is manifeſt by anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical obſervations, that nothing from the Brain by the <hi>Glandula pituitaria</hi> (which ſeems the only paſſage from thence) falls down into the Palate or Breaſt, but that the Serum there depoſited is conveyed by appropriate paſſages to the jugular Veins, and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to the blood. Moreover it is manifeſt to ſight, that whatſoever relique of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum is laid aſide in the Glandules of the Ears, Mouth, Noſe, or Face, is conveyed from them all by peculiar paſſages, inſomuch that no humor whatſoever deſtils from the Brain or the Palate into the Lungs.</p>
                        <p>But although matter exciting a Cough doth not deſtil from the Head by the <hi>Trachea</hi> into the Lungs, yet ſometimes falling down from the ſides of the <hi>Trachea</hi> into their cavities,<note place="margin">But ſweating out of the ſides of the Trachea.</note> it produces that diſeaſe commonly called a Catarrh. For the <hi>Aſpera Arteria,</hi> like the Arteries bringing blood, are endued with a nervous and muſculous Coat, and ſo do occaſionally enjoy ſenſe and motion, having alſo a glandulous Coat and full of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle veſſels to ſuſtain the vital heat and nouriſhment. Theſe laſt Coats make thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſpaces, and as it were cover the Cartilages. Moreover the ſuperfluous ſeroſities proceeding from the blood watering the <hi>Trachea</hi> are depoſited into this glandulous Coat, which for the moſt part preſently ſweating into the cavities of the <hi>Trachea,</hi> ſerves chiefly to make them ſlippery and moiſt: but if the maſs of blood be poured out too much, and precipitated into ſeroſities (as it frequently happens, a cold being taken, or the ſwallowing down of acid things, and on many other occaſions) for this cauſe a great plenty of watry matter ſweats out of the Glandules of the <hi>Trachea</hi> and mouths of the little Arteries into its cavities, which ſoon doth cauſe a moſt troubleſom Cough, and often much ſpittle (which afterwards comes to be conſumptive.)</p>

                           <note place="margin">The conſumptive matter brought into the Lungs rather by the pneumonic Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note>But ſurely this cauſe of Spittle and as it were a Catarrhal Cough very rarely comes alone, becauſe while the blood watering the Trachea having ſuffered ſolution, throws in its ſeroſities into the Glandules (whence preſently they ſweat into its cavities) and alſo the remaining blood being in like ſort diſſolved, it inſinuates its <hi>Serum</hi> ſet apart within the pneumonic arteries, partly into the tracheal hollowneſſes, and partly into the Lympheducts, by the overflowing whereof the Lungs are as it

A Cough and ſpitting of this kind as long as moderate,<note place="margin">A Cough and ſpitting ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times healthful.</note> only throwing off the ſeroſities of the blood, rather are beneficial than prejudicial; becauſe the maſs of blood, and the very lungs being throughly purged after this ſort, thoſe ſymptoms for the moſt part ſpontaneouſly abate, and from thence enſues a more perfect health. But if they be protracted a long time, the ſerous humour being on both ſides laid aſide into the tracheal paſſages, and from thence more plentifully daily heapt up, at length it will change into corruption; becauſe as well the free enjoyment of air is impeded, as alſo the motion of the blood, and its temperature wholly perverted; from hence a Cough becomes more fierce, and breathing more difficult; nay rather the whole maſs of blood in as much as it is defiled by the foul blood (which the Veins receive from the Lungs) degenerating by degrees from its benign properties, and being depraved, it not only continually pours forth the ſuperfluous Serum, but alſo the nutritive Juice (which it cannot aſſimilate) out of the pneumonic Arteries into the tracheal paſſages;<note place="margin">Yet often being too much is dangerous.</note> and ſo this maſs of conſumptive matter is daily increaſed, till the Lungs being more and more obſtructed and filled, and the blood being defiled, and rendred unfit to perform any of its functions, the Cough and Spittle become worſe and worſe, and preſently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come dangerous; Moreover breathing being hurt, the faintneſs and pining away of the whole body, the debility of all the functions, and at length a hectick feaver, and a haſty declination to death follows.</p>
                        <p>When by the long continuance of a Cough and Spitting, leaſurely encreaſing,<note place="margin">Why the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive matter affects, and by degrees hurts the lungs.</note> the humour is more plentifully depoſited out of the maſs of blood into the lungs, it firſt of all enters into the tracheal little bladders, and at length fills them, and ſomewhat diſtends them, from which while every morning by expectoration then more copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly performed, it is almoſt entirely caſt out from them, thence the <hi>Thorax</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt for a ſhort ſpace from the burden, and reſpiration ſeems more free: yet a little afterwards the blood being ſtuff'd again with <hi>Serum</hi> or nutritive juice, it pours down new matter into the lungs; and from thence again after meat or ſleep the little bladders are fill'd, and the humours by the afflux daily encreaſed, are more diſtended and enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and at length the ſides of two or more of the little bladders, being burſt, many little bladders are here and there framed as it were into one lake, within which the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive matter being more abundantly collected, there it putrifies (for it is not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely preſently caſt out) and from thence it corrupts the ſubſtance of the lungs, to which it is joined, and imparts a putrid defilement to the blood paſſing through it. This breach thus made in the lungs is daily encreaſed, and frequently more are at the ſame time formed in divers places, and by reaſon of the great plenty of humours heaped up and putrified in them, a heavineſs of the breaſt is felt, like a weighty bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den upon them, the breathing is more hindred; moreover from the tabid blood being more plentifully intermix'd with the maſs of blood, frequent efferveſcences of it, deſtruction of the nutritive juice, alſo thirſt, heat, loſs of appetite, nightly ſweats, and a pining of the whole body do ariſe.<note place="margin">How an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer of the Lungs is made.</note> But the blood being polluted from the lungs, cauſes them to be puniſhed with a reciprocal affection, that is to ſay from its peculiar pollution; becauſe the blood in the veins receiving this purulent matter in every circuit, it immediately delivers it into the arterial; from whence, whereas it cannot be ſent enough away by ſweat, or by Urine, it is brought back by the pneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monic arteries to the lungs, where again being ſeparated from the blood, it is every where conveyed as well into the little bladders of the Trachea as into the leſſer paſſages; inſomuch, that at length the whole frame of the lungs being filled, clefts or ulcers are formed conſequently in many places, and all the other hollowneſſes are ſtufft with frothy quitter.</p>
                        <p>But ſometimes it happens that there is one Ulcer or hole, or happily two formed in the Lungs, and the ſides grow callous round about, ſo that the matter being there gathered together is not conveyed into the maſs of blood, but is daily expectorated although in a vaſt plenty.

This kind of Cough one while is Catarrhal, inaſmuch as the Lympha having paſs'd through the maſs of blood, is depoſited in the Lungs by the arteries; another while it is convulſive, inaſmuch as the Nerves and fibres, conſtituted to move the breaſt, are poſſeſt by that liquor, and are provok'd into convulſive motions: from either cauſe either conjunct or ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately it comes to paſs, that more grievous paſſions of the brain and nervous kind frequently call on a troubleſom Cough, or are wholly changed into it.</p>

Hence it is a common obſervation, that the catching of a cold, by which the Pores are ſtopt, whether it be by the blowing of cold air, or being wet by rain, or leaving off cloaths, or by what other means it may come to paſs, diſpoſes very many to diſtempers of the <hi>Thorax.</hi> Wherefore in our Idiom the cauſe being put for the effect, a Cough is called <hi>Catching of cold.</hi>

                        <p>Theſe are the chief cauſes and occaſions which occur from the blood any ways de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved, and therefore depoſiting a peccant matter into the Lungs.<note place="margin">Partly from the Lungs.</note> There follow other cauſes in regard of the Lung it ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe which diſpoſe this Bowel more readily to a Cough or a Phthiſis, of which there are three ſorts. 1. An ill frame of the Breaſt.<note place="margin">From the breaſt ill formed. From the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary dispoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. From foregoing diſtempers of the breaſt. From incongrui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the air.</note> 2. An innate weakneſs of the Lungs, or hereditary diſpoſition to a Conſumption. 3. Preceding diſeaſes of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> as a Wound, a Blow, a Pleuriſie, a Peripneumony, Empyema, Spitting of blood, the ſmall Pox and Meaſles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 4. The incongruity of air which is inſpired (as deſerving a place among the procatarctic cauſes.) By reaſon of any one of theſe cauſes, and ſometimes of many together, the matter provoking a Cough, proving often after conſumptive, doth eaſily aſſault the Lungs, and enters them, and frequently imprints a deadly hurt. On each of theſe we ſhall inſiſt a little.</p>
                        <p>Firſt therefore as to the frame of the Breaſt the caſe ſtands thus: <hi>viz.</hi> that the Lungs being ſtill whole and ſound, and free from any phthiſical impreſſion, may be kept for a long time in their office, it will behove that they ſtill be exerciſed with a motion that is vigorous, and with ſtretched out ſails as it were to diſcharge the ſtrong interchanges of the Syſtole and Diaſtole; to that end, that the air being plentifully ſuckt in,<note place="margin">The reaſon of the former expoſed.</note> may be admitted to their inmoſt apartments, and from thence immediately be caſt back for the moſt part together with all the effluvia and ſooty vapours at every change of breath. Wherefore ſince the action of the Lungs doth depend much on the frame of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> as being the moving Engine, it muſt needs be, that by reaſon of its ill faſhioning, the function of breathing becomes defective in many things. There are two ſpecial kinds of a Breaſt ill framed, (<hi>viz.</hi> crookedneſs, and ſhoulders like wings) for which reaſon many are found prone to a Phthiſis: the reaſon of which is, that in any ſuch figure of the breaſt, being either depreſſed or made long, the Lungs do neither injoy a ſpace ſo free and ample, nor can the moving Muſcles be ſo ſtrongly contracted as in a ſquare breaſt.</p>

The procatarctic cauſes of a Phthiſis being now explained, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt as well from the blood as the Lungs, there is another common to them both, which may be juſtly added, and (although altogether extrinſec) hath great affinity with them both, <hi>viz.</hi> the condition or temper of the air breathed in. For ſuch is the influence hereof to ſome conſumptive perſons, that the cauſe of the diſeaſe is ſometimes wholly aſcribed to the incongruity of the air wherein they dwell, and for a cure the alteration of air or ſoil is preferred to all other remedies whatſover. Hence many of our Country troubled with a Cough, or being in a Conſumption, flock to the Southern parts of <hi>France;</hi> and others in the mean time who cannot go beyond Sea, or will not, preſently haſten to remove out of the City-ſmoke into the Country as to a moſt undoubted re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge: wherefore all our Villages near <hi>London,</hi> which injoy a clear and open air, are eſteemed as ſo many Spittles for conſumptive perſons.

                           <note place="margin">The groſſer and City-air to ſome conſumptive per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons healthful, to others hurtful.</note>The reaſons of theſe things do clearly appear out of the Doctrine of Breathing before handled; for we do demonſtrate the blood paſſing through the Lungs, both as to its kindling or vitality, and as to its motion doth chiefly depend on nitrous air ſuckt in; whence it is a conſequence, that the tenor of this ought to be ſo proportioned to the temperament of that, that the blood being moderately kindled within the <hi>Praecor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi>

Wherefore a moiſt, fenny, and cloſe air, as it is healthful to none, ſo to them that cough it is eſpecially hurtful; on the contrary, a ſerene and mild air, moderately injoying the Sun and wind, as it is healthful to all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſo it is friendly to all conſumptive perſons. As to other conditions of the air, ſome eſcape a Cough, or loſe it living in mountainous places expoſed to the Sun, where the impendent Atmoſphere being free from all thick, ſmoaky, and feculent va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours whatſoever, abounds with nitrous particles: for thoſe whoſe thick and feculent blood abounds with an impure Sulphur, to kindle this duly and to waſte the dreggi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, there is need of a very thin and nitrous air. If the Lungs be not too tender, but firm and ſtrong, they endure the more fierce aſſaults of its particles; on the other ſide, they who have a thin and ſubtil blood, eaſily diſſolvable and endued with a more
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40331:132"/> pure but very little Sulphur, and having tender and ſoft lungs, very ſenſible, and of a finer texture; theſe perſons being impatient of a nitrous and ſharper air, are moſt at eaſe and beſt in a thick and more ſulphureous one. Wherefore it conduces to theſe perſons, that they breathe the groſs and more fat air of a ſmoaky City; which to an impoveriſhed and more thin blood, doth afford Sulphur (which fails ſometimes) and alſo Nitre, and doth ſomething thicken and fix its ſubtile conſiſtence; moreover it dulls the ſubſtance or texture of a Lung too much ſenſible and more thin, and is a defence againſt the invaſions of a more ſharp and improportionate Air.<note place="margin">A ſulphureous air healthful to ſome conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptives.</note> It is manifeſt by frequent experience, that a thicker Air, provided it be ſulphureous, proves very benign to ſome phthiſical perſons (that I do not ſay to all.) It is a common obſervation, that a Conſumption ſeldom infeſts thoſe Regions either in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Holland,</hi> where fires are nouriſhed by turff, and do breathe a very ſulphureous odour, yea rather thoſe places are chiefly wholeſom and frequently fanative to perſons obnoxious to a Phthiſis, or labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under it. To which we may add, that a ſuffumigation of Sulphur and Arſenic (which is filled with much Sulphur) is reputed for the curing of almoſt incurable Ulcers of the Lungs, although the laſt, yet the moſt efficacious remedy.<note place="margin">Sulphureous Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines chiefly agreeing.</note> Moreover add to this, that pectoral Medicines prepared of Sulphur are far to be preferred to any other; ſo that Sulphur is juſtly reported by Chymiſts to be the Balſam of the Lungs. By what order and by what means theſe Medicines do work, and ſo nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly help in diſeaſes of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> we ſhall hereafter make diligent ſearch into: in the mean time that ſulphureous Air is found helpful to certain phthiſical perſons, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon conſiſts in theſe two things; <hi>viz.</hi> in the firſt place, as we now intimated, from ſuch an Air ſuckt in there is help brought to the jejune and depauperated blood and to the tender Lungs. Secondly, that the ſulphureous Particles being ſuckt in with the nitrous, do provide againſt,<note place="margin">The reaſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of diſcourſed.</note> or take away the acidities of any of the humours (by which their flowings and extravaſations into the Lungs do chiefly ariſe.) And for this reaſon it is that ſulphureous Medicines, being alſo taken inwardly, do confer ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a help to them that cough or are phthiſical: and therefore Sulphur, as I now hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, hath the report of being the Balſam of the Lungs. For as balſamic things applied to an Ulcer or Wound extinguiſh the acidity of the Ichor there ſweating out and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting and paining the little Fibres, ſoon eaſe the pain, and afterwards heal the wound; ſo alſo the ſulphureous Particles, paſſed into the Lungs either with the air or with the blood, in as much as they provide againſt or aboliſh the acidities of all humors, <hi>i. e.</hi> the blood, the Serum, the Lympha, the nervous or nutritive Juice, they conduce to the prevention or cure of a Conſumption.

                        <p>The conjunct and procatarctic cauſes of a Phthiſis being thus handled, it will not be neceſſary to diſcourſe much touching the evident cauſes. For in what manner a cloſing of the Pores by cold, a ſurfeit or tipling, and other errours of ſeveral ſorts, in the ſix non-naturals, diſpoſe to thoſe diſtempers, and ſometimes preſently do bring them, is ſo clear, that it needs no explaining.<note place="margin">The three times or diſtinct ſtates of a Cough.</note> Neither is there any reaſon we ſhould be long delayed about the Semiotical part of this diſeaſe; nevertheleſs it is fit we obſerve the divers ſtates or diſtinctive ſigns which certainly belong unto it. 1.

And in the firſt place what belongs to a new Cough, and as yet alone,<note place="margin">When new, there is no ſuſpicion of a Conſumption.</note> this taking its riſe from any cauſe whatſoever in bodies prediſpoſed to a Phthiſis, will ſcarce ever be free from the ſuſpicion of danger; but in a ſtrong man, and one who hath often before endured a Cough Scot-free, it will not be immediately to be feared: for when being ſtirred up from a more forcible evident cauſe, without Feaver or indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole body, it ſhall not be very troubleſom, then it meerly paſſes for a cold being taken, and is altogether neglected, or in a ſhort time is wont to be finiſhed without many or very conſiderable Remedies.

For then it may well be ſuſpected, that the Lungs being prejudiced in their ſtructure, do not circulate the blood entirely, but let fall the Serum and Lympha, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40331:133"/> or now and then uſed alone. Wherefore after Phlebotomy we uſe to preſcribe a gentle Purge, and ſometimes to repeat it. Among the Ingredients of the pectoral Decoction let the Root of Chervile, Butchers-broom, Elicampane, and other things that provoke Sweat and Urine be put. Hog-lice, volatile Salt of Amber, and other fixed Salts and Powders of Shells made into Pills with Turpentine are often given with ſucceſs.</p>

For the firſt intention it is, that Conſerve of red Roſes, Olibanum, Maſtich, Lohoch of Pine-tree, Syrup of Jujubes, of dried Roſes, of Cup moſs, and other Aſtringents are often put into the forms of Pectoral Preſcriptions. For the ſecond intention Liquoriſh, with the divers preparations thereof, is reputed a famous Remedy againſt any Cough: for this purpoſe Syrups and Lohochs, and all other ſweet Pectorals ſeem to be ordained. To which is added Oyl of ſweet Almonds, either adminiſtred by it ſelf, or brought with pectoral Syrups after a long ſtirring of them together into a milk-form liquor.</p>

The reaſon whereof without doubt conſiſts in this, that the Animal ſpirits being put to flight and forced into freſh diſtractions, they relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh their former diſorders; moreover, the convulſive matter is either diſſipated by that diſturbance, or is forced into other nerves where it is leſs troubleſome.</p>

Thirdly, to ſtrengthen and dry the Lungs looſned from their unity, or being too looſe or moiſt or otherwiſe infirm, leſt they be daily more and more corrupted, and give more reception to the morbific matter. Every of theſe indications ſuggeſts various intentions of heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and requires remedies of divers kinds and many ways of adminiſtrations. The chief of which we ſhall here briefly treat of.</p>
                           <p n="1">
                              <note place="margin">The firſt indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſuggeſts three intentions of healing.</note>1. Therefore what the firſt indication ſuggeſts, that the diſſolution of blood may be prohibited, theſe three things (as much as may be) ought to be procured: <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt that the maſs of blood may contain and aſſimilate whatſoever of nutritive juice it may be furniſhed with; and that it be ſo proportioned, that it neither offend in quality nor in quantity. Secondly, that the acidities either generated in the blood, or poured into it from ſome other place, may be ſo deſtroyed, that the blood retaining as yet its mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or temperament, may not be prone to flowings and pourings out. Thirdly and laſtly, that all the excrements produced in the blood may be derived from the Lungs to other Emunctories and places of Evacuations.</p>
                           <p n="1">
                              <note place="margin">The firſt intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritive juice may be propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to the blood and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milated by it.</note>1. As to the firſt intention of healing, <hi>viz.</hi> that the nutritive Juice may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to the blood, let it be adviſed before all things, that they who cough and are phthiſical abſtain chiefly from drink, and that they take liquid things in a very ſmall quantity; for that the blood being infirm in its temperament, ſo long as it is not too much imbued with freſh juice, may be able to digeſt ſmall portions, and retain it within its own conſiſtence. Moreover, let that freſh juice conſiſt of ſuch kind of particles, which being mild and thin, may be tamed by the blood, and aſſimilated without any efferveſcence or heat. Wherefore Aſſes milk, alſo ſometimes Cows or Goats milk; alſo Water gruel, Cream of Barley, Priſan, Almond-milks, and other ſimple nouriſhments will better agree and nouriſh more than Fleſh, Eggs, and Gelly-broaths,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40331:136"/> ſtrong Ale, Wine, or any other kind of richer fare. Secondly,<note place="margin">

Wherefore the Tincture, the Balſam, the Syrup, the Flowers, and Milk of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur in ſomewhat a large Doſe may be exhibited twice or thrice a day. For the ſame reaſon traumatic or vulnerary Decoctions, alſo Decoctions of the pectoral Herbs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſo called, alſo of the Woods, are to be taken inſtead of ordinary drink. Moreover the Powder of Crabs eyes, Hog-lice, and other things endued with an Alcali or volatile Salt are often adminiſtred with great ſucceſs.<note place="margin">

Theſe are ſaid to operate after a twofold matter, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which their virtue is conveyed two ways to the Lungs. For of thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken by the mouth, ſome immediately diſmiſs their active particles into the <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chea,</hi> which partly by making the way ſlippery, and looſning the matter impacted, and partly by provoking the excretory Fibres into Convulſions, do procure expectoration: in which number are chiefly accounted Linctus's and Fumigations. The expectorating Remedies of another kind, which deſervedly are accounted more available, do exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe their energie by the paſſage of the blood. For whereas they conſiſt of ſuch kind of particles which cannot be digeſted and aſſimilated by the maſs of blood, being ſpread through the blood, becauſe they cannot be mixt with it, they are preſently again exterminated, and ſo penetrate from the pneumonic Arteries into the tracheal paſſages; where lighting on the matter they divide, and attenuate, and ſo diſturb it, that the little fibres being irritated from thence, and ſucceſſively contracted while they cough, the contents of the Trachea and of its little bladders are ejected upwards into the mouth. Medicines proper for this uſe beſides Sulphur and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations of it, are artificial Balſams diſtilled with Oil of Turpentine, Tinctures and Syrups of Gum Ammoniac, Galbanum, Aſa foetida, Garlick, Leeks, and ſuch like yielding a ſtrong ſcent; from which alſo Lohochs and Eclegma's are prepared. And theſe work both ways, partly by ſlipping into the Trachea, and partly by entring the Lungs by the circulation of the blood, and aſſault the morbific matter both before and behind, and ſo exclude it with the greater force.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. What belongs to the third indication,<note place="margin">Third indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Balſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micks and vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neraries.</note>

                              <p>What hitherto we have diſcourſed of concerning a Cough of every kind (whether it be ſolitary and ſimple, or the forerunner and companion of a Phthiſis) alſo what is to be preſcrib'd in every caſe touching the method of healing, it would be eaſily illuſtrated by the hiſtory of Cures, or by the Anatomical obſervations on thoſe that have dyed by that diſeaſe. For inſtances of this ſort, and very many examples are every where had, and happen daily; it pleaſes us here to annex a few of the more ſelect, out of the large choice of theſe, accommodated to the chief kinds of a Cough, and Phthiſis. And firſt I will endeavour to illuſtrate the type of a ſimple Cough by one hiſtory or two, and which takes its riſe of it ſelf, and is altogether void of the ſuſpicion of a Phthiſis.</p>
                              <p>It is now many years ſince I took care of the health of a certain Student,<note place="margin">The Hiſtory of a Cough threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</note> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to a Cough from his tender years, and who was wont frequently to undergo the more painfull affections of it, and thoſe of long continuance. This perſon ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of a melancholick temper, of a ſharp wit, of an indefatigable ſpirit, of a conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution indifferently ſtrong, but that his Lungs originally being infirm, did ſuffer when the blood diſſolv'd into ſeroſities. In Summer as long as he tranſpired freely, he lived healthily enough; but in the Spring and Autumn, when the blood changing its tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament, thoſe ſerous fluxes came upon him either of their own accord, or from any ſleight occaſion, he fell eaſily into a Cough with abundant and thick ſpittle; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this diſtemper frequently within ſix or ſeven dayes, as ſoon as the maſs of blood was purged throughly by the Lungs, vaniſhed leiſurely without any great uſe of remedies. But if to the aforeſaid occaſions of this diſeaſe were added ſome ſtronger cauſes, as chiefly the obſtruction of the pores, and errors touching his diet, ſometimes a more prodigious and ſtubborn cough, neither preſently nor eaſily yielding to remedies, and threatning nothing leſs than a Phthiſis, did come upon him; then manifeſtly the patient for the firſt days ſuffered light ſhiverings in his whole body, and the ſenſe of a Gatarrh in his <hi>Larynx;</hi> afterwards by frequent cough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with thin ſpittle, together with a giddineſs, he was afflicted with numneſs of his ſenſes, and a dropping at his noſtrils.</p>

                              <p>If that theſe remedies together with the <hi>Canary</hi> Antidote and thin diet effected little, the diſeaſe not being ſo cured, ſpinning out into a long period, and preſſing him ſharply for many weeks, yea ſometimes months, it reduced the ſick to a remarkable leanneſs, and to the very brink of the Grave. For then the Gough daily encreaſing and being very troubleſome, did very much impede and break his ſleep, his ſtrength languiſhed, his appetite was dejected, heat and thirſt moleſted him; in the mean time ſpittle every day encreaſed, and was caſt forth in great plenty; ſo that not onely the <hi>Serum</hi> of the blood, and the recrements, but alſo the nutritive Juice, and the drain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the ſolid parts being continually poured out upon the lungs, turn'd into cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, which was abundantly cough'd out; moreover his breath was difficult, his joints very infirm, and his fleſh very much conſumed.</p>
                              <p>When of late our patient laboured after this manner, we preſcribed the following method, and remedies, by the continued uſe whereof at length he recovered his health.

As often as he was afflicted ſince then with a ſtubborn and tedious Cough, he uſed a method like this, and with the like ſucceſs; and now although he lives alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether exempt from that diſtemper, notwithſtanding he is conſtrained to decline care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully all occaſions or cauſes whereby either the pores might be ſhut, or the flux of blood or its precipitation into ſeroſities might be provok'd; which were chiefly his going by water on the <hi>Thames</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> and drinking of acid liquors, as Cider, French or Rheniſh wine.</p>

Afterwards the period of his diſeaſe being come (which happened not but by conſuming the ſtore of the morbific matter) he again in a ſhort time became healthy enough, and very free from any ſickneſs of the Thorax: till the morbific matter (as it ſeems) being heaped again to great abundance, without any evident cauſe, the ſame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40331:139"/> returned and performed its Tragedy with its wonted fierceneſs. About its firſt beginning the Cough was troubleſom only morning and evening: afterwards the evil by little and little increaſing, he almoſt continually coughed whole days and nights, and if at any time ſleep happening of it ſelf, or by the uſe of Anodynes, afforded any truce, a more outragious fit of coughing ſucceeded his wakening. After this manner moſt frequently and fiercely coughing without any ſpittle, he laboured for three or four weeks, till he was brought to an extreme leanneſs and weakneſs; and then the ſickneſs leiſurely remitted, ſo that he coughed ſomewhat ſeldomer, and enjoyed moderate ſleeps; afterwards in few days growing very hungry, being quickly made full of fleſh and vigorous, he recovered his former health in a ſhort time. Fits of this kind more ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom infeſted him in Summer-ſeaſon, but in the reſt of the year, repeated three or four turns, and brought the ſick even into great hazard of life.</p>
                              <p>If diſquiſition be made of the nature, cauſes, and formal reaſon of this unwonted and as it were irregular kind of Cough, it is manifeſt it proceeds like all others, from the provocation of the Lungs; nevertheleſs as to the matter exciting, its ſeat, and manner of affecting it is doubted: becauſe neither thick ſpittle, nor plentiful thin (as is uſual in other diſtempers) is here caſt out; neither doth the Patient complain of feeling a Catarrh, nor of any weight of the Lungs. Wherefore, not as in a common Cough, does the ſerous humour either ſlowly or plentifully ſweating out of the Trachea or pneumonic veſſels into the little bladders or pipes of the Trachea, induce the afore-mentioned ſymptoms: But it is plain from thence that the paſſages of the <hi>aſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra Arteria</hi> are wholly empty of the ſerous or thick humour, becauſe the deep and ſounding Cough throws off nothing. Moreover, neither from the blood impacted in the Membranes of the Lungs, doth this Cough take its origine, becauſe neither fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, nor thirſt, nor pain are preſent here as in a Peripneumonie. Beſides, neither doth the morbific matter ſeem to adhere to the nerves or muſcles appointed to the function of breathing; becauſe then beſides a Cough, Aſthmatical or otherwiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive fits would ſometimes urge with a ſenſe of ſtrangling; which notwithſtanding did not happen to our patient.</p>
                              <p>Having frequently and ſeriouſly meditated about the aetiologies of this very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult caſe, I am at length induced to think, that a certain ſerous and ſharp matter, as being loaded with a ſcorbutical taint, falling from the head by the paſſage of the nerves, doth enter into the nervous fibres and Membranes of the lungs or Trachea; which cleaving throughly to them, is by degrees encreaſed to a fulneſs,<note place="margin">The conjunct cauſe of the diſeaſe.</note> and at length be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chaf'd, and grown turgid with a perpetual provocation, creates ſo troubleſom a Cough. We have in another place declared the matter of this kind impacted in the Coats of the guts, and the neighbouring parts about them, not rarely to excite a ſcorbutical Colick, for many days, yea ſometimes weeks, infeſting them with vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting and a moſt ſharp torment; and what elſe is this Cough, but a certain convulſive diſtemper of the lungs, whoſe taint notwithſtanding, according to the capacity of the part labouring, is impreſt rather and more on the motive, than on the ſenſitive Power. For the lungs however twicht and hurt, do ſuffer ſmall pain, or ſcarce any at all; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding from any light occaſion, they are invaded by ſtorms and fits of coughing. Indeed we compare this diſtemper of coughing ſo much the rather to the Colick, becauſe the ſubjects of either of them, that is to ſay, the Trachea, and the guts, as to their coats, veſſels, little fibres and glandules, are after the ſame manner faſhioned.</p>
                              <p>The chief cauſe of the Cough now deſcribed, depends upon the morbific matter heaped together within the little fibres of the rough arteries, to a provoking fulneſs; wherewith when they are loaded, firſt a quick and painfull breathing infeſts onely, with a mornings Cough; becauſe from the beginning onely ſome ſmall portion of that matter being diſquieted provokes the part: afterwards when the whole maſs thereof growing turgid, almoſt perpetually twitches the fibres, there follows a moſt troubleſom cough; which alſo being often repeated, endures a long ſeaſon; becauſe the morbifick maſs impacted in the parts affected, is neither preſently caſt off by the ſtrength of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor eaſily gives place to any remedies.</p>
                              <p>For in all the fits of this diſeaſe, I have made tryal of various methods of curing, and of medicines of divers kinds, though with little ſucceſs. That diſtemper begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at any time, is wont to make a long period, maugre all remedies. The medicines commonly called pectoral, as Syrups, Lohochs, Eclegma's, or Lambitives, have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred little benefit to its cure; notwithſtanding ſometimes it hath ſeemed good to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:40331:140"/> admit of them into uſe for this purpoſe, that they might make ſlippery and moiſten the Lungs, leſt they run the hazard of being rent by a violent Cough, and their veſſels burſt aſunder: for ſometimes a more fierce fit troubling our ſick Patient, he hath been wont to cough out a little blood, though no thick ſpittle.</p>
                              <p>A gentle Purge both in the beginning and declination of this diſtemper hath ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed well. Opening and diuretical Apozemes are ever adminiſtred with ſucceſs, both which he uſed enough through his whole courſe inſtead of ordinary drink. Evening and morning he took ſome drops of the Tincture of Sulphur with the Milk-water of Snails; late at night I was ſometimes conſtrained to adminiſter a Doſe of Diacodion or of liquid Laudanum: his belly for the moſt part looſe enough, that it ſeldom required Clyſters: in two of his fits he breathed a vein, whereby nothing of ſucceſs enſued.</p>

Beſides which there are many other diſeaſes of thoſe parts that do occur, which when they are not at all, or not ſeaſonably enough cured, for the moſt part de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate into a Phthiſis. Theſe paſſions, or at leaſt the chief of them, (as we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hinted) are ſpitting of blood, an Impoſthume, or Ulcer of the Lungs, a Peripneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, Empyema, a Pleuriſie, a Tumor of the Lungs, and obſtructions by reaſon of things divers ways concreted, <hi>viz.</hi> ſometimes little Puſtles and Scirrhus's, another while gravel and little ſtones, and ſometimes other preternatural matter; and laſtly hitherto belong an Aſthma and convulſive diſtempers of the Breaſt. Of theſe we ſhall treat in order, and firſt of Spitting blood.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Spitting blood a diſtemper ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry frequent.</note>The ſpitting of blood out of the Lungs and the ejection thereof by Cough ſometimes leſs and almoſt none, another while more violent, is a diſtemper frequent enough, and truly an admiration it is, that it happens not more frequently. For whereas the veſſels bringing blood are divided into twigs and innumerable ſlips, and thoſe very ſmall; and whereas the blood even fiercely boiling, is violently conveyed through them all, complicated after divers manners and variouſly intorted; we can hardly conceive how
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:40331:140"/> the circulation thereof being ſo perplexed and intricate, and alſo ſo impetuous, ſhould be performed without ſome impediment and interruption. And truly we conclude it to be very difficult in living bodies, becauſe it hardly ſucceeds by injection in the dead: for as much as liquor ſent through the entrance of the pneumonic Artery, will not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily and eaſily return by the Veins; but ſticking longer in the paſſage, and skipping over the uſual paſſages, variouſly runs out into the little bladders and other canals of the Trachea, and into the interſpaces and other various gaps of the little Lobes.</p>
                        <p>Concerning an Haemoptoſis or ſpitting blood we are to conſider,<note place="margin">Three things to be conſidered concerning it.</note> firſt out of what veſſels, and by what diſtemper the blood burſts out; ſecondly in what places moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently laid up; thirdly by what means it is wont either to be ejected or brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that it may be diſcharged by the mouth.</p>
                        <p>As to the firſt, we are to ſuppoſe by the Law of Circulation, that the blood of it ſelf burſting out, doth altogether proceed from the Arteries: for the Veins, as long as they remain whole, do reduce it towards the Heart, and not at all pour it out; although we deny not that ſometimes they being hurt by a wound, fall, bruiſe, or ſome violent acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, ſo as to be looſned from their unity, do let go the blood out of their cavities.<note place="margin">Out of what veſſels the blood burſts out.</note> Nevertheleſs the blood moſt commonly cauſing an Haemoptoe or blood-ſpitting, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the little mouths of the Arteries being open or torn; and then the fault is wont to be either in the ill temperament of the blood, or ill framing of the veſſels.</p>
                        <p>Of either of theſe there are various kinds and differences,<note place="margin">By what fault both of the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and of the blood it happens.</note> which alſo concur after a diverſe manner to provoke the ſpitting of blood. For the blood being ſometimes more thin and alſo ſharp, it unlocks or corrodes the mouths of the little Arteries; and ſometimes again being more thick and prone to coagulate, when it cannot readily enough be received by the Veins, it is extravaſated. By reaſon of theſe faults in the blood, they who labour with the Scurvy or with a peſtilent Feaver, as alſo thoſe who have drunk ſome ſort of poiſon, do frequently fall into a ſpitting of blood. Neither is this diſtemper leſs wont to ariſe from the fault of the veſſels, in as much as thoſe being too tender or too thin, many times are burſt by a violent motion, as by coughing, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, leaping, or other vehement exerciſes; or for that being too looſe and moiſt, their mouths open, and ſuffer the blood to break out of its circulation: moreover ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for that the Veins being contracted and wrinkled by cold, do not readily paſs away the blood, but the ſame reſtagnating diſtends the little Arteries, and burſts out of their mouths.</p>
                        <p>As to the Arteries, out of which the blood breaks, cauſing a ſpitting of blood,<note place="margin">What Arteries chiefly and where placed do void blood.</note> it concerns much of what ſort they are, and where they are placed; for beſides that there ariſe notable differences of bloody ſpittle, according as the blood breaks out from a ſmaller or a greater veſſel; and if either of them be placed in the top of the Lungs near the Larynx, or in the middle region thereof among the greater branches of the veſſels, or laſtly in the lower region among the orbicular little bladders: moreover we obſerve, that the Arteries which uſe to void blood, are either of the number of them,<note place="margin">Both the pneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monic and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheal are in fault.</note> which ariſing out of the pulmonary Trunk, do every where accompany the branches of the Trachea; or of thoſe which owning their origine to the Aorta, do cover the coat of the Trachea with a thick branching.</p>
                        <p>For it is apparent (as we have declared before) from the mouths of theſe, as alſo of the Glandules, an unctuous humor ſweats out to make the inner ſuperficies of the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chea ſlippery:<note place="margin">Spitting blood from the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheal Arteries.</note> moreover in as much as a ſerous humor diſtils abundantly out of the ſame into the cavity of the rough Artery, a Catarrh ariſes. Wherefore we doubt not at all to affirm, that even from the mouths of theſe being open, meer blood ſometimes ſoaking into the Tracheal paſſages, does propagate a bloody ſpittle, though in quantity very ſmall. I have obſerved many, who without a Cough or any indiſpoſition of the Lungs, have once or twice a day voided one or two bloody ſpittles: which as often as it came upon them, the Patients perceived, either in the bottom of the throat, or on the top of the breaſt a kind of diſtillation; whence immediately by the meer contraction of the Tracheal Fibres, with a Snail-like motion, a little of the fluid blood being mixed throughly with flegm, and not at all frothy, is voided: and when ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times that diſtemper had laſted for many months, no prejudice enſued from thence, which might bring or threaten a Phthiſis: which would not have come to paſs, if any of the pneumonic Veſſels had been opened.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. So much concerning Veſſels voiding blood, and of their divers affections.<note place="margin">
                              <hi>2.</hi> In what pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the blood is depoſited.</note> What belongs to the places wherein the extravaſated blood is depoſited, theſe chiefly and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt only are the rough Artery, and the inward cavity of the parts thereof. For into
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:40331:141"/> this, as into a Jakes, all the filth or ſuperfluities of all the reſt of the paſſages are deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the utmoſt endeavours of Nature, as far as is poſſible, to be preſently ſent out of doors. But if the extravaſated blood be thrown into the interſpaces of the little Lobes, or ſoaking out of the outer Membrane, fall into the cavity of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> it doth propagate an Empyema, and frequently an Impoſthume in that place. But for the moſt part the blood ſubject to fall from the pulmonary courſe, produces various kinds of bloody ſpittle; according as it makes its neſt, either upwards within the cavity of the Larynx,<note place="margin">Either in the Larynx, or in the middle of the Bronchii, or in the orbicular little bladders.</note> or a little beneath about the intermedial paſſages of the Trachea, or laſtly further within the orbicular little bladders. The firſt diſtemper proceeds alone from the mouths of ſome Artery being opened, which covers the trunk of the Trachea; the next ſometimes perhaps from this cauſe, yet more often from the pneumonic Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries themſelves being open or burſt aſunder, which veſſels as they are greater, pour out often a dreadful quantity of blood; the ſpitting out whereof proves plentiful and violent, in regard that the muſcles of the whole breaſt, together with the fibres of the Trachea are much provoked and greatly contracted. But if the ſpring of bloody ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle conſiſts in the lowermoſt little bladders, the blood is thrown out more ſparingly, but with a profound, frequent, and very troubleſom Cough.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. And from hence (which was in the third place purpoſed) the differences of bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy excretion out of the Lungs, and the manifold modes and courſes of bloody ſpittle are made known. For the blood ſoaking into the Larynx, after a ſmall tickling in the throat without coughing or hawking, doth eaſily and almoſt inſenſibly aſcend into the mouth: and if an extravaſation of this kind of blood happens in ſleep, it preſently flows out of the mouth upon wakening, they being ſcarce ſenſible of it; in as much as the moving fibres of the Trachea being contracted while one ſleeps, have then emptied the blood freſh diſtilled into the mouth. But if from a greater veſſel gaping or burſt about the middle of the Lungs, the blood (which is ever frothy) does break out abundantly into the Tracheal paſſages, this by an outragious Cough raiſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is forthwith caſt upwards with violence and in great plenty; inſomuch that the ſick ſeem rather to vomit than cough out blood. And finally, if the blood breaking out of the foldings of the veſſels wherewith the orbicular little bladders are incompaſſed, falls down into thoſe little cells, from thence it is diſcharged by turns in leſſer quantity, and not unleſs by a ſtrong and very frequent Cough.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">The procatarctic and evident cauſes thereof.</note>So much concerning the formal reaſon, the conjunct cauſes and differences of an Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moptoe: as to what belongs to the primary and evident cauſes, either of them are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold and various. In the former number are reckoned, firſt an hereditary indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Lungs, whenas they have originally been weak and ſoft with a ſtraitneſs of the breaſt. Moreover their ill temper from a Cough, Empyema, or Pleuriſie going before, and eſpecially an obſtruction or ill conformation do very much diſpoſe to ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting blood, and ſo much the rather, if in ſuch a habit an acrimony or Dyſcraſie of the blood ſhall accrue from an ill courſe of Diet, unwholeſom Air, or by any other means. The ſuppreſſion of the Menſtrua, the Haemorrhoids, or blood flowing from the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils incline moſt to a ſpitting blood. Secondly, among the evident cauſes ought to be reckoned primarily the exceſs either of heat or cold; for when the blood grows above meaſure hot, or the tranſpiration thereof through the Pores of the skin is hindred; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſwelling after a huge manner, it frequently burſts out of the pneumonic Veſſels. From hence <hi>Hippocrates</hi> long ago obſerved, and as yet it is a vulgar obſervation, That ſpitting blood moſt frequently happens in the winter when the North-wind blows. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leſs ſeldom hath the uſe of bathing brought this evil upon many, before the uſe whereof they were healthful enough. Moreover many contract this from drinking of wine and ſtrong waters, from a blow, a fall, hollowing, vomiting, coughing, or any other violent ſtirring of the whole body or of the Lungs. Alſo certain poiſons, and according to <hi>Heurnius</hi> the Lunar beams (the reaſon whereof doth not eaſily appear, neither doth there remain any credit thereto) are reported to provoke this diſtemper.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">The Progniſtics of this diſeaſe.</note>The Prognoſtics of this diſeaſe are enough known to the vulgar, whereas there is not any one of them, who doth not ſuſpect the ſpitting of blood as very dangerous. Nevertheleſs whereas the kinds hereof are various, one is found more or leſs dangerous than another. The blood ſoaking out of the veſſels of the Trachea is often free from any evil: moreover when breaking out from the loweſt and leſſer pulmonar Veſſels, it often admits of Cure; at leaſt it is much ſafer than a plentiful ſpitting of blood hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening from the great branches of the Artery being opened into the Trachea. But the prediſpoſition of the Patient makes a great difference in the Prognoſticks of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe:
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:40331:141"/> for if blood-ſpitting be provoked by reaſon of a ſolitary evident cauſe, and ſhall happen to a body formerly ſound and well ſet, there appears far greater hope of help, than if the diſtemper ariſing of its own accord ſhall happen to a cachectical, phthiſical, ſcorbutic, or otherwiſe ſickly body. However 'tis a common obſervation, that this diſeaſe is dangerous and always difficult to cure: the reaſon whereof is alſo clearly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, for as much as the function of the Lungs conſiſting in a perpetual motion, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together contrary to the method of healing a wound, whereto primarily eaſe and reſt are required. In like manner this happens to be a greater hindrance to its Cure, in as much as the frame of the Lungs is not a Parenchyma (as was thought) but a texture or very ſubtile web of innumerable veſſels; the unity whereof if once diſſolved, it will be altogether impoſſible for the ends of the disjoined veſſels to meet again together, or the ſpace to be filled up with fleſh or callous, as in other parts. But there is this only to be hoped, that while the ends of the veſſels grow together incongruouſly and always imperforated, the circulation of the blood ceaſing in the part diſtempered, may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by another neighbouring part: which indeed rarely ſucceeds without hurt or prejudice of the whole Lungs.</p>
                        <p>As to what appertains to the Method of healing the Haemoptoe or ſpitting blood,<note place="margin">The Cure thereof.</note> the curative indications ſhall be chiefly theſe two, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſtay preſently and reſtrain the flux of blood; then ſecondly, to heal the diſſolution of unity without any relicts of a Conſumption in the Lungs.</p>
                        <p n="1">I. As to the former, theſe two things are chiefly to be procured,<note place="margin">I. <hi>Indication.</hi>

                           <hi>viz.</hi> firſt that blood flow not to the part diſtempered; and ſecondly, that in the mean time the opening of the veſſel may be ſome-how ſhut.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That the blood may not flow to the part diſtempered,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>1.</hi> It ſtops the flux of blood.</note> there are many intentions of healing in uſe, <hi>viz.</hi> it will be requiſite to diminiſh the abundance of blood, to reſtrain the boiling thereof, to alter the intemperament, and depreſs its motion or divert it another way: for which purpoſes Phlebotomy, Ligatures, and Frictions are often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient: alſo Juleps, Decoctions, Emulſions, and ſucculent Expreſſions of Herbs ought to be drunk. Likewiſe moderate Hypnotics, and in the firſt place Diacodiates are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited with ſucceſs: for theſe, by reſtraining the motion of the Heart, do force the blood to cool.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That the opening of the veſſel may be ſhut,<note place="margin">

The chief of theſe are uſed to be exhibited in the form of a Linctus, ſo that while one ſwallows, certain particles gliding into the rough Artery, may more immediately communicate their power to the part diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. But the reaſon of this operation ſeems not to be of any great moment; becauſe the efficacy of the Medicines themſelves, chiefly and almoſt only by the conduct of blood reaches to the ſeat of the diſeaſe. Wherefore not only Lohochs, but alſo De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctions, Powders, and Pills of vulnerary and balſamic Ingredients are preſcribed with ſucceſs. The forms hereof we ſhall annex beneath.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. The ſecond indication, which is alſo preſervatory,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>II.</hi> The ſecond preſervatory in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication.</note> reſpecting the healing of the diſſolution of unity without any remaining hurt of the Lungs, ought to provide againſt two ſorts of evils, <hi>viz.</hi> leſt the ſpitting blood (whereunto the diſtempered are afterwards always prone) begin again; and leſt a Phthiſis ſucceed, which threatens every body ſubject to the Haemoptoſis. For theſe ends for the prevention of this diſeaſe daily care and conſtant courſe of healing ought to be miniſtred to the blood and Lungs.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. As to the blood, the maſs thereof ought to be contained ever in a due quantity,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>1.</hi> It respects the blood which is to be kept in a right Craſis.</note> and a right temperament, with a mild and equal motion. Hence leſt it ſuperabound, or diſtempered with a Dycraſie enter into turgeſcencies, or lodge its impure feculencies in the breaſt: it is requiſite ſometimes to uſe Phlebotomy and a gentle Purgation. An exact courſe of Diet is always neceſſary. Moreover for the depurating and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the blood, drinking of Aſſes milk, or of Medicinal waters ſometimes does greatly help. But Decoctions, diſtilled Waters, Juices of Herbs, which carry away the ill temperaments of blood, and derive the Serum and other impurities from the Lungs, and bring them forth either by Sweat or Urine, are to be carefully drunk. Beſides for this purpoſe Iſſues do chiefly conduce.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Neither ought there to be leſs care of the Lungs themſelves,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>2.</hi> A due frame of the Lungs to be procured.</note> namely that the whole frame thereof, and chiefly the place affected, be preſerved in due frame and right tone. Hence every violent motion, whereby its unity is more diſſolved, or the reſtitution thereof hindred, ſhould be induſtriouſly declined. Let the party live
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:40331:142"/> in a clear and open air, but not too fierce, or ſharp; let him abſtain from groſſer foods, from Noon-ſleeps, from plentiful Suppers, and other errors in diet, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce either repletion or obſtruction upon the <hi>Praecordia.</hi> But let remedies be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in daily uſe, which by a peculiar property, or certain ſpecifick vertue are reported to heal the Lungs.</p>
                        <p>The method of healing requiſite for ſpitting of blood, being ſhadowed after this manner, there yet remains as to all the therapeutic indications, and according to the various intentions of healing which belong to them, for us to ſubjoyn ſome more choice forms of Remedies, whoſe Van thoſe deſervedly lead which meeting with the ſymptom moſt urging, do ſuddenly reſtrain the flux of blood caſt out by coughing or otherwiſe out of the Lungs. In the firſt rank of theſe Medicines thoſe are reckon'd which hinder the blood from flowing to the part affected, and together are impregnate with a certain aſtrictive and agglutinative power whereby the opening of the veſſel may be ſhut;<note place="margin">The forms of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines.</note> and after the Belly being cleared with a Clyſter, and Phlebotomie (unleſs a weak pulſe and defect of heat withſtand it) made uſe of, there is wont to be given ſomewhat in form of a Julep, Decoction, Emulſion, juicy Expreſſion, Powder, Pills or Lohochs. We will annex certain more elegant and more efficacious Receipts of all of theſe, as likewiſe of Narcoticks, which notwithſtanding ought not every where and indifferently to be uſed, but methodically and ſeaſonably, according to advice of a diſcreet Phyſician, according to the various conſtitution of the patient and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the diſeaſe.</p>

                           <p>
                              <note place="margin">The firſt Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory.</note>A noble young man, when after a ſcorbutical <hi>Cachexia</hi> he was affected with a Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and for curing this diſeaſe, remedies not only great but improportionate to the blood and ſpirits were experimented by him, <hi>viz.</hi> Salivation and the uſe of Baths,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:40331:143"/> he contracted a ſpitting of blood, whoſe fits (of all I ever knew not preſently mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal) were moſt fierce. Preſently on the firſt appearance of this diſeaſe, ſpitting blood followed the Operation of <hi>Hues</hi>'s powder (from which having for ſome time ſuffered a flowing of the Mouth, without his Palſie being cured he was reduced to great weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:) Then being afflicted with a Catarrh, and a Cough very troubleſome, he began to diſcharge a diſcolour'd Spittle, ſometimes ſtained, and ſometimes ſprinkled with blood; but this diſeaſe being mild from the beginning, did ſuddenly vaniſh away by the uſe of remedies, and after going into the Countrey, and ſucking in a more pure air, he became better, and after a while ſeeming healthful enough in his breaſt, he went to the Bath, for the benefit of his Palſie; where daily bathing for a fortnight in thoſe hot waters, he again contracted a Cough, and a little after an horrid Haemoptoe or a ſpitting of blood, ſo that in the ſpace of 24 hours, coughing often and plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, he poured out blood in a vaſt quantity.</p>
                           <p>I firſt viſiting him in this condition, proviſion being made for the whole, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed preſently Phlebotomy for revulſions ſake: notwithſtanding after this admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration (both then and ever after) he either repeated the bloody ſpittle, or grew worſe. Moreover, I exhibited Juleps, Lohochs, Decoctions, and alſo Hypnoticks, which helping little or nothing, ligatures made about his arms and thighs, did firſt of all reſtrain the tyranny of this diſeaſe: And when afterwards the Evil broke out again, I perſwaded him at length, (his drink of Beer being left) that he ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly drink the decoction of China and Sarſa with the Pectorals. By the continual uſe hereof, obſerving moreover an exact courſe of diet, and altogether abſtaining from wine, more hot aliments, and Salt, and Sugar, for above two years he was well in health.</p>
                           <p>But afterwards when by being crouded in a Court of Judicature, he grew mighty hot, he relapſed back again into a terrible ſpitting of blood. A Phyſitian being ſent for, he was preſently let blood in the arm, whence his ſpitting of blood became more ſharp; and when afterwards letting blood was repeated the ſecond and third day, and the evil grew worſe every time, at length Ligatures (as at firſt) being adminiſtred, and the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoral drink and a Linctus being often taken, the diſeaſe preſently remitted, and in a ſhort ſpace wholly ceaſed; notwithſtanding he continued the uſe of his pectoral de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction and ſlender diet, <hi>viz.</hi> no fleſh-meat, for a fortnight; and from thence he obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed truce from his enemy for three years; and when afterwards at any time the blood ſwelling by drinking of wine, or taking more dainty food, began to break out from the Lungs, preſently by ligatures, and the uſe of the Decoction and Lohoch, and a thin diet, its aſſault was wont to be repulſed. But he did not ſo ſafely eſcape, but that it was neceſſary for him for the moſt part to keep perpetual watch againſt that enemy always lurking: for not long ſince by reaſon of the intemperature of the year, he contracted a troubleſom Catarrh, with a Cough, a plentifull ſpittle, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times bloody, and then the former medicines effected leſs; wherefore, he betook himſelf by his own advice to new things, and in the firſt place took evening and morning a ſpoonfull of Syrup of Ground-Ivy, and thereby enſued a notable help: but when that Syrup became quickly loathſome by reaſon of the Sugar, he took the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of that herb well prepared to half a dram, or one dram twice a day in a ſpoonfull of ſome liquor; by the long uſe of which Medicine he was much better as to his Catarrh and Cough. But when the ſpitting of blood now and then broke out, though in little quantity, he chang'd again his Medicine, and took twice in a day the powder of the tops, and chiefly of the hairy excreſcences of Cynorrhodon or Dog-bryer: which only medicine a certain Phyſician renowned formerly for the cure of ſpitting blood, uſed with great ſucceſs. Neither did our Patient receive a leſs happy effect from that medicine, for preſently after he eſcaped altogether free from a Cough, a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarrh and bloody Spittle, and ſo remained for a long while: untill at length believing this diſeaſe of the Breaſt to be wholly ſubdued, and therefore ſlighting it, he aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med weapons againſt the other more ancient enemy the Palſie. Wherefore, while his Haemoptoſis or Spitting of Blood was neglected, he daily took a large doſe of hot Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines to conquer that other diſtemper, <hi>viz.</hi> magiſtral waters diſtilled with Wine, ſpirit of Harts horn, of Salt Armoniack, and Aromatick Powders and Confections; Beſides, whilſt he indulg'd himſelf in a more plentiful diet, with a moderate drinking of Ale and Wine, the roaring Lion that at firſt ſeem'd to ſleep, was again ſtirr'd up, <hi>viz.</hi> he had not long continued in that antiparalytical Method, but the Spitting of blood returned with its greateſt fierceneſs, ſo that in the ſpace of a day and a night he
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:40331:144"/> coughed out above three pints of ſpumous blood. But afterwards a Phyſician being ſent for who preſently preſcribed Phlebotomy, the ſpitting of blood began to ceaſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on bleeding (as formerly it was always wont to do) but then fell into ſharp fits again: which however by the uſe of Ligatures, and a Lohoch and pectoral Decoction daily taken, was preſently aſſwaged, and a while after wholly ceaſed. And when afterwards he uſed the pectoral Decoction three months, and a very ſlender Diet, <hi>viz.</hi> without any fleſh, only of Herbs, Barley, &amp;c. and Milk-meats, in a ſhort time he recovered his former health, and now lives in that ſtate, ſo triumphing over that cruel diſeaſe, that many Haemoptotic perſons conſult him as their Oracle, and for a Cure do propound a method of this kind of living to be followed before the Phyſicians advice.</p>

Moreover what he himſelf obſerved, contrary to many others, that his ſpitting blood happened never in winter, but in Summer, came alſo ſo to paſs by the ſame reaſon: becauſe when the blood did leſs abound with vaporous recrements, the opening or obſtruction of the Pores were neither an advantage nor prejudice to it; nevertheleſs the blood growing hotter than it ought to be, ſeeing it exhaled not, there was a neceſſity it ſhould break out of the veſſels; and when again diminiſhed in quantity, ſending away little or no ſerous Ichor out of the orifices of the veſſels, the ſpitting of blood ceaſed without a remaining Cough. The ſame reaſon holds of many that ſpit blood, wherefore ſome are found much inclinable, others not prone to a Conſumption. This Gentleman ever found the uſe of the pectoral Decoction advantageous to him: wherefore when he often varied other Medicines he always retained the ſame Decoction: moreover he hath commended it to many others ſpitting blood with ſucceſs.

As often as his ſpitting blood intermitted, the rankneſs of breath and ſpittle ceaſed alſo; afterwards the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn hereof declared conſtantly that other affect to be preſently attendant. In this
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:40331:144"/> languiſhing condition, when this Renowned man was diſcovered to favour the Kings Party at that time oppreſſed with a grievous Tyranny, and being caſt into a ſtrait Priſon, did drink meer water inſtead of ordinary drink, he recovered his health beyond the hope and expectation of all perſons, and ſo remained indifferently healthful for above ten years ſpace. Nevertheleſs afterwards, I know not by what occaſion, unleſs by the hardſhip of a cold winter, not only the aforeſaid evils, <hi>viz.</hi> a Cough with bloody and ſalt ſtinking ſpittle did become fierce upon him, but alſo over and above, a debility of ſtomach, want of appetite, and a nightly Feaver did accrue. But not long after theſe Symptoms a little remitting, fair weather again ſeemed to ſhine out; until on a certain day, the air being ſuddenly changed into an intenſe cold, towards night he was aſſaulted with great ſtraitneſs of breaſt and difficult breathing, with a quick and weak pulſe, and fainting of all his ſpirits, as if he had been expiring. Nevertheleſs from this danger he ſuddenly eſcaped by the interpoſition of a Criſis, <hi>viz.</hi> by a plentiful ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of blood, and after by a breathing Sweat: but from that time his ſpittle remitted much of the uſual ſtench, and ſomething of its ſaltneſs; and when in a ſhort time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the laſt and moſt painful invaſion of ſpitting blood threatned him, that uſual preſage from ſtench of breath was wanting; but the ſubſequent ſpitting of blood being very plentiful, did ſo debilitate his ſtrength, that from that time declining ſenſibly, he expired within a month: and when a little before his deceaſe, by reaſon of a ſharp pain in his ſide, a Vein was breathed, his blood ſeemed to fail ſo, that almoſt none ſtreamed out. Moreover in his body diſſected after death very little quantity of blood was found: nor could they find any footſteps of the other moſt notable Symptoms, <hi>viz.</hi> ſpitting of blood and of the ſtinking breath and ſpittle; for there was no colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of any filth or ſtinking and putrid matter, nor any cavity in the Lungs made by an Ulcer or Wound; but only one lobe of this bowel, or rather the whole left ſide was ſo hardned from a ſcirrhous Tumor, that the blood could not eaſily or but very little paſs through the frame being ſo obſtructed, and as it were ſtony: wherefore it is no marvel, if the blood that ſhould have paſſed moſt ſwiftly through the Lungs, did now and then burſt out in ſome place from the veſſels, which were joined together, or ſuffered not a circulation by reaſon of the Schirroſity.</p>
                           <p>Notwithſtanding here a greater difficulty ariſeth, <hi>viz.</hi>
                              <note place="margin">The reaſons of the caſe.</note> whereas his Lungs were found altogether free from any Ulcer or notable wound, whence that moſt dire ſtench of ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and breath, always a forerunner and companion of the bloody ſpittle (the laſt inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this diſeaſe only excepted) proceeded. We have in another place given re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks upon all theſe things, as that Ulcers of the Lungs and the purulent ſpittle of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive perſons ſeldom or never ſtink, but the matter caſt out of an Impoſthume of the Lungs doth frequently ſtink: but that in the ſick Doctor the Lungs being free from either affect, breathed out ſo horrible a breath, the reaſon will beſt of all appear, if we inquire of the manner and cauſe of a ſtench in general. For we obſerve this to be excited when the impure Sulphur is diſſolved either by a lixivial, or an acid Salt, and is precipitated by the other. Let common Sulphur, or Sulphur of Antimony be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Oil of Tartar or Stygian water; afterwards if you pour on this ſolution a diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of fixed Salt, and upon that, Vinegar, a moſt hideous ſtench will ariſe. In like manner we may conceive in the caſe propoſed, that the ſulphureous particles of the blood being very impure, were corroded by the fixt Salt, with which its juice abounded very much; afterwards when the acid humor, having endured a flux, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flows from the nervous parts into the maſs of blood, it precipitates the diſſolved Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, and ſo cauſes that ſtench to be exhaled from the Lungs, and whilſt it forces the blood into a turgency, a little after it compels to a ſpitting of blood. I have known ſome endued with a breaſt firm enough, and free from all Coughs and conſumptive diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, who have for the moſt part breathed out a moſt hideous ſtench: which could proceed from no other cauſe, beſides what even now we have obſerved. The impure blood abounding with Sulphur diſſolved with Salts, if perhaps while it is rarified with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Lungs, and looſned in its frame, it meets with an acid humor, it will exhale in breathing putrid and horrid effluvia's. It happens by the like reaſon of the blood otherwiſe diſpoſed, that as the breath of ſome perſons is very ſtinking, ſo of others ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſweet. And indeed the breath or air reciprocated through Reſpiration, for that it carries out with it the effluvia's of blood highly rarified within the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> one while diſperſes a grateful vapor, another while a moſt unpleaſant.</p>

                           <note place="margin">The deſcription of a Peripneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</note>A Peripneumony is uſually defined to be, an inflammation of the Lungs with an acute Feaver, a Cough, and difficult breathing. They who labour with this diſtemper are greatly ſenſible of a notable inflammation in their breaſt with a ſwelling of the Lungs, and ſometimes a pricking pain, they draw a painful and ſhort breath, or, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> affirms, a deep breath; the Feaver preſſes with great thirſt, watching, and painful Cough; whereto alſo bloody ſpittle, or ſtreakt with blood, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds. By which Symptoms it clearly appears, that this diſeaſe ariſes, in as much as the blood boiling feaveriſhly, doth not eaſily paſs through the leſſer pneumonic Veſſels; but ſticking in their paſſages, begets firſt an obſtruction, afterwards being more heaped and extravaſated, propagates a Phlegmon or inflammation with heat, a Cough, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coloured ſpittle. Moreover in as much as the blood ſo accumulated and ſtagnating, puffs up theſe paſſages of the Lungs, and compreſſes them, a difficulty of breathing is cauſed; and in as much as it pulls or diſtends the nervous Fibres, a pain frequently ariſes.</p>

                           <note place="margin">After what manner a Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon is bred in the Lungs.</note>But if it be asked, how a Phlegmon ſhould grow together in the frame of a Lung meerly bladdery and excarnous; and after what manner it is diſtinguiſhed from that diſtemper which is wont to be ſtirred up in muſculous fleſh, or the ſubſtance of a bowel? We muſt anſwer, although the above-mentioned parts vary as to the texture, notwithſtanding the reaſon of the affect is altogether the ſame in each of them. For the ſmall ſanguiferous veſſels do every where alike embrace, bind, and variouſly gird about both all the Tracheal paſſages in the Lungs, and alſo the fleſhy fibres in the Muſcles, and laſtly the little fibres and nervous threds, with the thickeſt foldings like cluſters, of the Parenchyma. But that which produces a Phlegmon is the blood it ſelf, which, while it grows very hot, and is hindred in its paſſage, every where, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the Lungs, whoſe veſſels branch into very ſmall foldings, doth firſt beget an obſtruction, and then an inflammation.</p>

                           </note>Wherefore the formal reaſon and conjunct cauſe of a Peripneumony conſiſts in theſe two things, <hi>viz.</hi> that the blood boils feaveriſhly, and ſticking alſo within the more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row paſſages of the Lungs, engenders there an obſtruction cauſing inflammation. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs theſe two things concur, there is an exemption from this diſeaſe; for in many other Feavers, eſpecially in a burning Ague, though the blood, moſt intenſly heated and inflaming all the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> as alſo in the longing of women, the Green-ſickneſs and the Dropſie of the breaſt, is very clammy, yet though ſticking very much in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of the Lungs, it does not ſtir up a Peripneumony: to produce which both diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers muſt concur and join their ſtrength. Nevertheleſs when there is an indiſpoſition of both theſe, one while this, another while that, is firſt in act, and after a ſort one is the cauſe, or at leaſt the occaſion of the other. For ſometimes the blood irritated into a Feaver cauſes an obſtruction of the Lungs; and the blood alſo ſometimes finding a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mora in the Lungs, receives a feaveriſh boiling from its proper obſtruction. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, for the conſtituting the procatarctic cauſe of this diſeaſe, the blood ought to be fitted as well for the boiling, as for the obſtructing the veſſels of the Lungs.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">What that is Phlebotomy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers.</note>Though it will not be eaſie to ſhew what this diſpoſition of the bloody liquor is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to a Peripneumony, yet the reaſon thereof doth ſomething appear by Phlebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy, always made uſe of in this diſeaſe with the beſt ſucceſs. For the blood being drawn from any labouring with this diſeaſe, as alſo from thoſe in a Pleuriſie, after it grows cold, in its ſuperficies inſtead of a Scarlet cream, it hath a little film ſomewhat white or otherwiſe diſcoloured growing on it, which alſo is very tough and viſcous: whence we may conjecture, that the maſs of blood being too ſtrait in its frame, whilſt that in the circulation it doth not diſcharge its recrements, grows too thick, and as it were clammy, and for that cauſe becomes too prone as well to boil as to ſtick within the narrow paſſages, and eſpecially of the Lungs.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">What affection of the blood pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces it.</note>But if farther inquiſition be made, from whence this diſpoſition of blood proceeds, by which it becomes clammy and viſcous like ropy wine; the general reaſon hereof is this, <hi>viz.</hi> that the more thick parts of blood are not made thin enough by the more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile; ſo that all of them being equally mixed and mutually incorporated, at length the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:40331:145"/> good humors ſeparate themſelves into their appropriate functions, and the ſuperfluous are perpetually diſcharged by their proper Emunctories. But on the other ſide in as much as the ſulphureous particles of the blood being combined together with the ſaline and earthy too much exalted, enſnare and entangle all the reſt; for that cauſe its li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor containing within it ſelf all its recrements and impurities, grows clammy as glue, and in that regard contracts an inflammable diſpoſition.</p>
                        <p>For it is obvious to every perſon, that the blood that grows clammy in this manner, is rendred prone to obſtruct the narrow paſſages of the veſſels (which ſurely are very ſmall in the Lungs); moreover for the ſame reaſon they are diſpoſed to become fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh: <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe retaining obſtinately within its own boſom all the feculencies and recrements, from the ſame preſently gathered into a heap, it is conſtrained into a great turgeſcence or ſwelling, whereby of neceſſity an inflaming obſtruction of the Lungs takes either its origine or augmentation.</p>
                        <p>Moreover as to the procatarctic cauſe of this diſeaſe,<note place="margin">The fault of the Lungs produces it.</note> very frequently the faultineſs of the Lungs is joined herewith, and determines that general intemperament of blood to affect this part in ſuch a ſort. For as the clammy blood grows hot, the more ſtrong and ſound <hi>Praecordia</hi> do frequently diſcharge the deſigned miſchief from themſelves, and the taint being fixed to the Pleura, or about the habit of the body, a Pleuriſie or Rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſm is rather cauſed than a Peripneumony. Nevertheleſs the tender Lungs being obnoxious to a Cough, or formerly prejudiced in their frame either by ſpitting blood, or other diſtempers of the breaſt, from the blood boiling up (while it is too much bound and clammy in its own conſiſtence) they eaſily engender an obſtructing Phlegmon.</p>
                        <p>Hitherto of the conjunct and procatarctic cauſes of a Peripneumony:<note place="margin">The evident cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of a Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pneumony.</note> as for what regards the evident cauſes, whatſoever ſuddenly perverts the temperament of the blood, or reſtrains its free tranſpiration ought to be referred hither, as chiefly are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of heat and cold, or the inordinate drinking of Wine or ſtrong Waters, any ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement exerciſe, and the drinking of ſome waters, and thoſe eſpecially icy. Beſides, ſometimes a malignant diſtemperature of Air doth engender this diſeaſe in many, and makes it Epidemical.</p>
                        <p>Authors in Phyſick do every where obſerve (and it is alſo a vulgar obſervation) a Peripneumony frequently ſucceeds or comes upon a Pleuriſie;<note place="margin">It often ſucceeds or follows after a Pleuriſie.</note> but nothing is more uſual than in a Pleuriſie a bloody and thick ſpittle, and as it were purulent to be void<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Hence a great diſquiſition ariſes, by what paſſage or ways the matter by ſpittle caſt out, can be conveyed from the Pleura to the Tracheal paſſages. Some think, that this being fallen into the cavity of <hi>Thorax,</hi> is ſucked into the Lungs as with a Sponge; and others ſuppoſe, that it is transferred thither by the Membranes adhering thereto, by which the Lungs often ſtick unto the Pleura. But truly either way ſeems impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, if not impoſſible. For firſt, that the Lungs do not ſuck in the contents of the hollowneſs of the Cheſt is manifeſt from hence, becauſe in a Dropſie or wound of the breaſt, when they happen, the Lungs being unhurt, neither water nor blood is at all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged by coughing; though frequently great plenty of this or that humor be there, which preſently flows out of its own accord from the <hi>Thorax,</hi> inciſion being made. But that ſometimes the Membranes growing from the Lungs, knit themſelves to the Pleura, is clearly manifeſt by Anatomical obſervation; yea and by this way of return I have ſometimes known the purulent matter tranſlated into the ſide, and there by an Iſſue, made by Art or Nature, to have been evacuated with a heathful Criſis: nevertheleſs ſuch Membranes of the Lungs joined to the Pleura do ſeldom pre-exiſt, and in a Pleuriſie, which is a very acute diſeaſe, they cannot, like a Muſhroom, be the iſſue of one or two days: moreover, though ſometimes thoſe obſcure paſſages may be ready at hand, which perhaps by ſome admirable inſtinct of Nature diſcharge ſomething out of the Lungs towards the precincts of the <hi>Thorax;</hi> yet it ſeems againſt the Oeconomy of Nature, that they can derive any corruption outwardly engendered to this moſt noble part within, which ſurely is the fountain both of life and heat.</p>
                        <p>As to this, if it may be lawful to propound our Judgment,<note place="margin">The reaſon of this is inquired into.</note> I am induced to think that a Peripneumony and Pleuriſie are one while ſingular and ſeparate affects, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while bred together and coexiſting from the firſt, and another while are by courſe one after another or ſuccedaneous. For the procuring cauſe being ſtirred up into act, ſo that the blood growing clammy, and boiling together, obſtructs in ſome places the leſſer veſſels: the neſt of the diſeaſe ſometimes is faſtned on the Pleura, or ſeparately in the Lungs, ſometimes in each of them together, and ſometimes firſt in one, and then in t'other: but for the moſt part, the Pleura being firſt healed, preſently the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:40331:146"/> ſame morbific cauſe invades alſo the pneumonic Veſſels. Moreover we have known a various ſhifting of this affect; <hi>viz.</hi> that it has firſt troubled the right or left ſide, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently that being deſerted, to have occupied the Lungs, and afterwards both being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, to affect the Brain, and frequently to transfer its ſeat from thence into the above-mentioned places. But for the reaſon aforeſaid a Peripneumony not only ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds a Pleuriſie, but frequently a Squinancy, and ſometimes other diſtempers: for while the blood growing clammy, and boiling together, continues a Feaver in the whole, it transfers the obſtruction cauſing a Phlegmon variouſly hither and thither. And from hence the ſolution of that obſervation is clearly manifeſt, which has ſo much puzled Interpreters, <hi>viz.</hi> that a Palſie or dead Palſie of one ſide doth ſometimes ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed a Peripneumony, becauſe the blood that being clammy, had lately obſtructed the pneumonic Veſſels, afterwards ſtuffing certain foldings of the veſſels of the Carotides, prohibits the engendring of animal ſpirits in this or that part of the head, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains their influence into the reſpective nervous parts.<note place="margin">The differences of this diſeaſe.</note> From what hath been ſaid, the chief differences of a Peripneumony are made plain, namely that it is either a ſimple diſtemper, or joined together with a Pleuriſie, Squinancy, or ſome other, and then it is either primary or ſecondary. Moreover it is uſually diſtinguiſhed as to the Feaver and ſtate of breathing: to wit, according as this is more or leſs prejudiced, and as it ſhall be more intenſe or remiſs, this diſeaſe alſo is denominated either more or leſs acute.</p>

No leſs may we conclude this from the reaſon or Etiology of it; for a wound with much extravaſation of blood, or a ſtagnation cauſed in the Lungs, is moſt difficultly cured, and the affected place is never reſtored unto its former conformation. The prognoſtic ſigns, which are of greateſt note, are taken from the appearance of Symptoms and nature of things thrown out, and the ſtate of ſtrength.</p>

A Peripneumony coming upon a Pleuriſie or Quinzy, for the moſt part is worſe than ariſing of it ſelf, or ſucceeding either of them: but if upon this diſeaſe, after what manner ſoever begun, an acute Feaver follows with great thirſt, watchings, and not breathing unleſs ſet upright, it is ill; and yet much worſe, if upon it a Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium, a Frenzy, convulſive motions, or a Palſie on one ſide enſue.

For while theſe Symptoms are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant upon him, the obſtruction of the blood in the Lungs is not removed, nothing is digeſted or ejected by ſpittle; but the circulation of the blood being more and more hindred, and its kindling by breathing ſtopt, the animal ſpirits are throughly diſorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and at length faint, until together with a proſtration of the whole ſtrength the vital flame is extinguiſhed.</p>

The Urine being yellow from the beginning, and of a good conſiſtency, with a cloud in the midſt, ſhews that almoſt all the recrements of the blood are lodged in the place affected; when from that ſtate it is changed into a thick and turbid Urine, it ſhews the morbific matter to be ſwallowed up again from that part into the blood; but if ſuch kind of Urine be ſuddenly changed into a thin one, then a Delirium or death it ſelf is impendent. Much Sweat and plenty of Urine, a Diarrhoea, bleeding at Noſe, flowing of the Menſtrua's, or the Haemorrhoids do fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently promiſe good in this diſtemper, yea any of theſe Evacuations happening ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably doth frequently diſcharge the diſeaſe.</p>

Fourthly, that we apply to the Symptoms moſt urgent, <hi>viz.</hi> a Feaver, Cough, Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and difficult Breathing, fit Remedies. But if notwithſtanding all theſe another indication ſhall come into uſe, it will be requiſite to preſcribe maturating and expecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating Medicines vulgarly ſo called, together with theſe.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That we may ſatisfie the firſt and ſecond intention together,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>1.</hi> The firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention that the afflux of blood may be cut off. <hi>2.</hi> That the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travaſated be reduced to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation.</note> Phlebotomy is for the moſt part requiſite in every Peripneumony, yea ſometimes it ought to be more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently repeated; for the veſſels being emptied of blood do not only withdraw the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment of the diſeaſe, but do alſo ſup up the matter impacted in the place affected. Wherefore if ſtrength remain, and the Pulſe be ſtrong enough, a more free breathing of a Vein is convenient at the very beginning; but otherwiſe let it be uſed in a little quantity, which however may be repeated as occaſion offers it ſelf. We intimated above, that blood drawn in a Peripneumony and alſo in a Pleuriſie, after it is cold, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in its ſuperficies a ſmall viſcous and diſcoloured film: moreover we may obſerve one while the blood entirely, another while only a portion thereof is ſubject to this change. For when the blood is received into three or four diſhes, ſometimes in all, but oftener in the ſecond and third diſh it is apparently bad, and in the firſt and laſt laudable enough: wherefore they commonly give it in precept, that blood is always ſo long to be emitted, till that which is ſo depraved begins to come forth; and if ſtrength remain, the bleeding ſhould continue till the good blood flows out again. Truly as common experience doth approve of this practice, even ſo doth reaſon it ſelf; for in this diſeaſe,<note place="margin">Rules concerning Phlebotomy.</note> becauſe the whole maſs of blood doth not preſently acquire that clammineſs, the depraved portions are chiefly accumulated about the place of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and adhere on every ſide in the leſſer veſſels. Wherefore the blood firſt iſſuing by Phlebotomy is often void of any fault; afterwards the veſſels being emptied receive the other morbific matter at firſt ſtagnated, and reſtore it to its circulation; and when the portions thereof being placed near, are carried as it were in a joint troop, they flow out together at the orifice of the opened Vein, and after that entire maſs of bad blood hath flowed out, the reſidue being more pure doth ſucceed. Wherefore in this caſe ever let inciſion be made with a large orifice, and let the blood be drawn out not only with a more plentiful ſpouting, but alſo with a continued: for otherwiſe if in the midſt of Phlebotomy, the bad blood iſſuing out, the orifice (as the manner of ſome is, leſt the ſpirits ſhould faint) be cloſed with the finger, when again it is opened, the blood pure enough will iſſue next, but the bad ſliding by, if there be any remaining, will not return preſently to that orifice. Beſides Phlebotomy many other remedies, <hi>viz.</hi> whatſoever do repreſs the turgency of blood, and empty the paſſages thereof, whereby the morbific matter may be ſuckt up, are here to be uſed. Wherefore a very thin diet is preſcribed for the moſt part meerly of Barley and Oats: and if Cathartics are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether prohibited, becauſe they diſquiet the blood, and hurry it more impetuouſly into the part affected; notwithſtanding Clyſters which gently looſen the Belly, and draw the recrements of the blood towards the Belly, ought to be daily uſed. Moreover Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leps and temperating Apozemes which bridle the fervor of the blood, and draw out the ſuperfluous ſeroſities thereof, and which alſo do gently open the paſſages of the Breaſt, are taken with ſucceſs.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The third intention of healing,<note place="margin">The third inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of healing is that the clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineſs or viſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the blood may be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</note> which reſpects the withdrawing of the clammineſs or obſtructing viſcoſity of the blood, is altogether to be performed by remedies which unlooſe the frame thereof being too much bound, and diſſolve the coupling together of its ſalts. And truly the remedies of this kind, which in this reſpect reaſon and analogy would dictate, are now received into uſe by long experience. For Powders of Shell-fiſh, the Tooth of a Boar, and the Jaws of a Pike, and other things endued with an Alkali Salt, alſo Sal Prunellae, for the moſt part are preſcribed by all Practitioners, as well modern as ancient. I have more frequently known the Spirit of Salt Armoniac and of Harts-horn to have yielded notable relief in this diſeaſe: and for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it is, (<hi>viz.</hi> becauſe the volatile Salt is uſeful) that the infuſion of Horſe-dung, though a common remedy, affords oftentimes ſingular help.</p>

As to the Symptoms and their Cure, very many remedies appropriated to theſe fall in together with the former; for againſt the Feaver the ſame Juleps and Apozems which appeaſe the heat of blood, and withal recreate the animal ſpirits are of moſt common uſe: to which beſides in reſpect of the Cough and difficult breathing, temperate pectoral Remedies are added.

                              <p>It would be eaſie to heap up here many Hiſtories and Inſtances of Patients affected with a Peripneumonie; but whereas the ſame order and figure of the diſeaſe, and the ſame reaſons of the Symptoms are almoſt in all, it ſuffices here to note one or two Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples only.<note place="margin">The firſt Hiſtory.</note> And while I was writing theſe things I am ſent for to a Patient grievouſly ſick with a Peripneumonie. He was aged about Fifty years, lean in body, and of a cholerick temper, by taking cold he fell into a Feaver, with a Cough, with pain of the Breaſt, and difficult breathing: when he had laboured thus four dayes without any remedy or phyſical adminiſtration, I found him in a notable Feaver, with thirſt, and a huge inflammation of the Precordia, breathing very difficultly, with labour of the Thorax, and painfully, with a noiſe of the Bronchia, inſomuch that he ſeemed evidently in the very Agony of death. His Pulſe being ſtrong enough (although quick and diſturbed) I immediately preſcribed Phlebotomy, to eight or ten ounces, by which when he received a little relief, after three hours intermiſſion, a Clyſter being firſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, I ordered him to repeat his bleeding to twelve ounces: Moreover, I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Spirit of Harts-horn to be given twelve drops every ſixth hour, with an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate Julep, and in the diſtance between I ordered a doſe of the following Powder to be adminiſtred:</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Take powder of Crabs-eyes, ſal Prunella, of each one dram and half, Pearles a dram, Sugar-Candy two ſcruples; make a powder to be divided into</hi> 8 <hi>doſes.</hi>

                              <p>Moreover, he took as often as he pleaſed a draught of a pectoral Apozeme. By the uſe of theſe within three hours all the ſymptoms began to abate, and the night following he ſweat, and ſlept a little; the day after I repeated Phlebotomy, and after continuing the ſame Remedies in four or five dayes he intirely recovered his health. The blood we took from him was alwayes in the Superficies viſcous and diſcoloured.</p>

                        <p>HOw great affinity there is between a Pleuriſie and Peripneumonie,<note place="margin">The diſeaſes of a Pleuriſie and Peripneumonie are akin.</note> we have hinted before; <hi>viz.</hi> although either diſtemper is ſometimes ſolitary, and exiſts ſeparately from the other, yet they often happen together, or one while this, another while that, come one upon the other, or ſucceeds it. The foregoing cauſe is the ſame of both, <hi>viz.</hi> a diſpoſition of the blood to be clammy and boyl up withall; alſo, the conjunct cauſe is the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> an obſtructing Phlegmon in ſome part of the leſſer Veſſels, by reaſon of ſuch a diſpoſition of blood. Moreover, the ſame method of Cure is preſcribed by moſt modern Phyſicians for either diſeaſe: The chief reaſon of the difference whereby they are diſtinguiſhed one from the other, is taken from the places affected, which their Names denote.<note place="margin">How they differ betwixt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</note> For the blood prediſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the enkindling in ſome place an enflaming obſtruction, therefore often plants the neſt of the diſeaſe in the breaſt, becauſe here it burns out more hideouſly, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Hearth of vital fire; and alſo is not freed from the vaporous Effluviums and other Recrements which hinder Circulation. To all which there enſues, that in this Region, the maſs of blood being ſhut up, and not able to paſs through the more ſtrait Conveyances; is not as in the bowels of the lower Belly, opened with any ferment, or new waſht with any watery juice: wherefore, if perhaps the blood, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried through the vertebral Arteries into the membrane encompaſſing the ribs, ſhall ſtick in its paſſage, about the narrowneſs of the Veſſels or inter-ſpaces, the Diſtemper of which we now treat ſucceeds: In like manner, if an obſtruction happen within the paſſages of the Lungs, a Peripneumonie will enſue, as we have declared before. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, according to the Pathologie of this diſeaſe before delivered, thoſe things which belong to the Theory of a Pleuriſie, as well as the Curatory method, may with ſmall labour be deſigned.</p>
                        <p>Both the ſenſe of pain,<note place="margin">The ſeat of a Pleuriſie.</note> as well as Anatomical Obſervations taken from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients dead of a Pleuriſie do plainly atteſt, the ſeat of this Diſeaſe (as often as it exiſts primarily and ſolitarily) conſiſts in the Pleura or Membrane environing the inſide of the ribs. And a true and ſingular Pleuriſie is an inflammation of the Pleura it ſelf, from the abundant flowing in of inflamed blood, growing clammy withall, taking its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through the vertebral Arteries, with a continual and acute Feaver, a pricking pain of the ſide, a Cough and difficulty of breathing.</p>
                        <p>The next Cauſe is the blood obſtructed by reaſon of its clammineſs in the leſſer veſſels and interſpaces of that membrane (in like manner as it is in a Peripneumonie) or being extravaſated, being heaped in the ſame place more plentifully,<note place="margin">The next cauſe of it.</note> by reaſon of the ſwelling up, for that cauſe exciting an inflammation. An acute pain ariſeth upon this, by a wound in a part highly ſenſible; alſo there ariſeth a Cough by reaſon of a provocation giving impreſſion to the intercoſtal muſcles; moreover a difficult breathing by reaſon of the muſcular fibres being hurt as to their action; which becauſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perform long and ſtrong contractions, they are conſtrained to undergoe weak although more frequent Contractions: otherwiſe than in a Peripneumonie, in which that ſymptome ariſeth from a Lung too much fill'd and ſtuffed. The Feaver is caus'd from efferveſcence of blood, and is for the moſt part rather the aſſociate than the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:40331:149"/> of a Pleuriſie. For the blood from what cauſe ſoever driven into a feaveriſh tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſcency, if it be bound up together in its maſs, will be apt to grow clammy, which together with the Feaver moſt often induces a Pleuriſie or a Peripneumonie, or both of them. From hence we may obſerve this diſeaſe doth frequently vary its kind, and change its place, <hi>viz.</hi> from a Pleuriſie into a Peripneumonie, and on the contrary; afterwards it paſſes from both or either into a Frenzy or a Squinancy: for that the blood while it is boyling throws off its viſcous recrements one while in this part, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while in that, another while in more together, and laſtly it reaſſumes them again, and variouſly transferrs them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">The more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote cauſes of this Diſeaſe.</note>The more remote cauſes of a Pleuriſie are the ſame as of a Peripneumonie, <hi>viz.</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſtirs up the blood, prediſpoſed to grow clammy and alſo to boyl up, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes a feaveriſh turgeſcency. Hither appertains exceſs of heat and cold, a ſudden conſtipation of the pores, ſurfeit, drinking of Wines or Strong-waters, immoderate exerciſe; ſometimes the malignant conſtitution of the Air brings this diſeaſe almoſt on every body, and renders it Epidemical: whereto may be added, that this diſeaſe is very familiar to ſome from their conſtitution or cuſtome; ſo that a diſtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature of blood, induced almoſt by any occaſion, immediately paſſes into a Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſie.</p>
                        <p>From what we have already ſaid, the ſigns of this diſeaſe do appear manifeſt enough, by which it is well known as to its Eſſence, and is diſtinguiſhed from other diſeaſes, and eſpecially from a Baſtard Pleuriſie and a Peripneumonie. But it is to be obſerved that a pain in the ſide ariſes ſometimes very troubleſome, which while it counterfeits a Pleuriſie, is ſometimes taken for it, although falſly. For in ſome perſons obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Scurvy, and the affects of the nervous kinde, ſometimes it happens that a ſharp humour, and very painful deſcends into the Pleuta or intercoſtal Muſcles, and being fixt there produces moſt fierce tortures; which diſtemper is yet diſcriminated from the Pleuriſie, inaſmuch as it is void both of Feaver and Thirſt, the Pulſe always abides moderate and laudable, frequently the appetite and ſtrength endure; more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the pain is not long fixed or limited to one place, but ſenſibly creeps hither and thither into the neighbouring parts, as the matter ſlides down through the paſſages of the fibres, out of one place into another.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">The differences of it.</note>We meet not with many differences of this diſeaſe; notwithſtanding it is uſed to be diſtinguiſhed, <hi>viz.</hi> to be either true and exquiſite even as we have now deſcribed, or ſpurious, which having its ſeat in the intercoſtal muſcles, or their interſpaces, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from winde, or a ſerous and ſharp humour heaped up in the ſame place, and raiſes a pain leſs ſharp, without ſo much as an inflammation or feaver: And whereas the grief is planted externally, the Patient for the moſt part lyes better on the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite ſide, otherwiſe than in a true Pleuriſie. Secondly, a Pleuriſie is either ſingle, or complicated with a Peripneumonie or ſome other diſtemper, and ſo it is either prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or ſecondary, or join'd with ſome other affection.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">The Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks.</note>As to the Prognoſticks of this diſeaſe, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> hath obſerved many certain to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens whereby a good or evil event is ſignified to patients ſick of the Pleuriſie. To run through each of theſe, and to unfold them with Commentaries added to them, we have neither leiſure, nor doth it ſeem worth our endeavours. The chief thing of all in a Pleuriſie, is, that the diſeaſe be preſently diſpatch'd, partly with a free and frequent bleeding, and partly by a Critical Sweat, ariſing about the fourth day, or before the eighth; or theſe things not duely ſucceeding, it will be prolonged, and then moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a Peripneumonie or Empyema, or a collection of corrupt matter between the Breaſt and Lungs, or both diſtempers do ariſe upon this diſeaſe; from which there follows a ſolution of the diſeaſe but ſlow and incertain, and moſt frequently full of dangerous chances.</p>
                        <p>A Peripneumonie coming upon a Pleuriſie not preſently cured (as it is often wont to be) all our hope is placed in digeſting maturely the Spittle and quick Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectoration thereof: for if this be laudable and plentiful, and eaſily and haſtily thrown off, it doth often finiſh both diſeaſes intirely. Notwithſtanding, it is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a conſequent that the matter of a Pleuriſie is derived from the ſide into the Lungs by I know not what blinde paſſages, or that the ſame being ſweat out of the Pleura into the cavity of the breaſt is imbibed by the Lungs, and at length drawn upwards through the paſſages, and excern'd forth. But when a Peripneumonie ariſes on a Pleuriſie, and the matter impacted in the Lungs begins to be evacuated by Spittle, ſo that the affected places of the Lungs are continually emptyed; the blood reſumes
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:40331:149"/> the other matter fixed in the Pleura, and carryes it to the Lungs where the places or conveyance are open, to be ejected by Spitting. But if the Pleuriſie be cured neither by it ſelf, nor aſſociating with a Peripneumonie, then at length either by an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſthume made in the Pleura or in the Lungs, an Empyema or corruption between the Breaſt and Lungs ſucceeds; or all the matter being brought into the Lungs and there putrified, looſning the unity of the Viſcera, it propagates a mortal or ſcarce curable Conſumption.</p>
                        <p>As to the cure of a Pleuriſie, foraſmuch as the ſtate of this Diſeaſe,<note place="margin">The Cure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</note> the Criſis and tendencies are manifold, divers curatory Indications offer themſelves according to their various regards; and as occaſion ſerves, according to the advice of a prudent Phyſician, they ought to be appointed in the beginning, and ſometimes altered or continued. For ſurely one Method is convenient for a ſolitary and ſimple Pleuriſie, and another if it be complicated with a Peripneumonie: Beſides it behoveth to ordain another and another if perhaps a Criſis be expected by Spitting, or matters growing worſe, the diſeaſe is either paſſing into an Empyema, or tends to a Conſumption. As to the three later caſes, that is to ſay, when a Pleuriſie commencing, paſſes into a Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pneumonie or Empyema, or laſtly into a conſumptive diſpoſition, there is deſigned an appropriate way of curing in the pathologies of each of theſe diſeaſes particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delivered. But as to what appertains to our preſent purpoſe, three Indications offer themſelves for a primary and ſimple Pleuriſie, and they are curatory, preſervatory and vital.</p>
                        <p n="1">I. The firſt Indication takes care that the Inflammation or obſtruction of blood in the Lungs by all manner of means with all expedition be removed;<note place="margin">The firſt Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> for which intent phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botomie in every Age by all phyſicians (excepting ſome Fanatick or falſe Chymiſts) is wont to be preſcribed, as a principal remedie: The reaſon of which is altogether the ſame as in a Peripneumonie and many other diſtempers,<note place="margin">Phlebotomie ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary almoſt in all Pleuriſies.</note> cauſed by reaſon of a ſtop of blood in ſome place, and ſo an accumulation: Becauſe that the veſſels bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blood being much emptyed, do not only reſcind the nouriſhment of the diſeaſe, but drink up the matter which is the conjunct cauſe thereof, and convey it to another place. Wherefore blood is to be freely drawn away in a Pleuriſie, if the ſtrength en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it, and the Pulſe be ſtrong. And ſurely it is far better that the firſt time and every time after (as often as there is need to repeat it) blood be more largely emitted, than to do it more often and more ſparingly. For very many portions of the blood growing clammy and degenerating into viſcouſneſs, are heaped up about the place af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; which, unleſs they are call'd away from thence by emptying the Veſſels through large phlebotomie, and in a great part let forth, the letting of blood will be fruſtrated of its deſired effect. Wherefore, that Phyſicians preſcribe blood in a Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſie to be drawn out even to ſwooning, ſeems not incongruous to reaſon, although that practice is not raſhly to be attempted, for that every evacuation ought to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to the tenour and tolerance of the ſtrength, which rule ſuch a phlebotomy doth exceed.</p>
                        <p>But though there is almoſt a general conſent of all Phyſicians to breath a vein in a Pleuriſie, notwithſtanding there was ever an earneſt contention about the place,<note place="margin">What Vein is to be opened in a Pleuriſie.</note> what Vein ought to be opened. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> opened a Vein on the ſame ſide of the patient; afterwards the <hi>Arabians</hi> and their followers the <hi>Italians,</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> did either open the <hi>Saphene</hi> or the <hi>Baſilica</hi> of the oppoſite ſide, damning the phlebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy of the ſame ſide by Bell, Book and Candle. Yet in the later generation, the practice of the Ancient <hi>Greeks</hi> by little and little revived,<note place="margin">Various opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are recited.</note> ſo that ſome did dare to make inciſion on the ſame ſide; yet always one ſide judged the others of the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite perſwaſion as it were guilty of murder, as often as any unlucky event did happen. So that while among Phyſicians about phlebotomy there was no leſs a contention than among the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Samaritans</hi> about the Sacred place of Worſhip, at length the Doctrine of the Circulation of the Blood held out like a new Light by the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned <hi>Harvey,</hi> diſcuſs'd all the clouds of this Controverſie; ſo that immediately it clearly appeared to be almoſt the ſame thing, whether inciſion be made in the Vein on the affected or oppoſite ſide of a patient ſick of a pleuriſie; although in our Age Cuſtom hath prevailed firſt and rather to open the Vein of the affected ſide. Notwithſtanding a Vein being opened in either Arm draws nothing at all immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from the vertebral Arterie or from the pleura; they are only the branches of the Azygos, or of the vertebral vein that receive the blood out of the place affected: but that they may accompliſh this, they are not unloaded in any other manner, but
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40331:150"/> that the quantity of the whole blood be abated by phlebotomie whereſoever made. Onely this may be affirmed for opening rather the vein of the affected ſide, that the Baſilick vein being unloaded, the Arteries of the Arm receive the more ample pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of blood; from hence the bloody ſtream of the vein Aorta runs down more ſwiftly from that ſide towards the branches of the Arm, and perhaps in the interim of its quick paſſage it infuſes leſs blood into the vertebral Arteries, for the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the diſeaſe. As to that opinion, that the blood is ſometimes more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully carryed from place to place, that from hence the right Lung or Liver being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet with an inflammation or obſtruction, the right part of the head is in pain, and of the face grows more red; I ſay this ſometimes is brought to paſs, becauſe the patients do conſtantly lie in their bed on the ſide affected; wherefore, the Veſſels being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd, the blood ſtays longer in other parts of the ſame ſide while it is circulating. But of theſe things we will make a more diligent ſearch when we ſhall render the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory and Aetiologie of phlebotomy.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Cupping-glaſſes with Scarifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſupply the place of blood-letting.</note>But if phlebotomy by reaſon of a weak pulſe, and fainting of the animal function, neither ought to be at firſt adminiſtred, nor repeated, though the pain be moſt urging; Cupping-glaſſes with Scarification do well ſupply the turn hereof, being applyed to the place pained. <hi>Riverius,</hi> and <hi>Zacutus Luſitanus</hi> have cited notable Examples of cures effected by this remedy. And ſurely this practice ſeems to lean upon a reaſon ſtrong enough; for the blood being drawn away from the ſide affected, that which is lodged in the neighbouring veſſels, being the conjunct cauſe of this diſeaſe, is moved with it, and partly drawn away, and partly turned to its Circulation. Moreover, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move an inflammation of the Pleura, beſides withdrawing blood by a free Phlebotomy or Scarification, alſo the ſerous and other excrementitious humours ought to be gently ſolicited and excerned as well out of the maſs thereof, as out of the bowels, by Stool, Urine and Sweat. The more ſtrong purgatives are deſervedly prohibited, becauſe they diſquiet the blood, and conſtrain it to be impacted more deep into the places affected. And that certain renowned Chymiſts, viz. <hi>Angelus Sala, Hartman, M. Rulandus,</hi> with many others, do audaciouſly exhibit Vomits of Stybium to any af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with a Pleuriſie, and magnifie it for the beſt remedy, ſeems to me neither ſafe nor congruous to reaſon;<note place="margin">Whether Purges and Vomits are to be taken in a Pleuriſie.</note> the only reaſon of helping, as I think, and that very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, and full of danger, may be, <hi>viz.</hi> that the medicine operating more vehemently while the patients ſuffer exolution of ſpirits or ſwoonings, all the vigour and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſcence of the blood abates, and for that cauſe the nervous Fibres remit their wrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings or painfull contractions, and the Veſſels carrying blood being much emptyed, do ſuck up the morbifick matter: In the mean time, there is danger leſt the humours being violently diſturbed, ruſh more impetuouſly to the part affected; at leaſt, leſt the Spirits being too much dejected, and the work of Nature diſquieted about the digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or ſeparation of the morbific mater, ſtrength ſhould utterly fail, before the diſeaſe be cured. Yet in the mean time, Clyſters are of frequent or daily uſe: yea ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more benigne ſolutive purgatives are allowed, provided that the Feaver be not very intenſe.<note place="margin">What other kind of Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient in this diſeaſe.</note> Julips and temperating Decoctions and things gently moving Sweat and Urine, as we have preſcribed before for a Peripneumonie, are alſo here conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient; but let all hot and ſharp things, whether aromatick, or endowed with a vinous ſpirit be carefully declined.</p>

The third Indication vital which provides that the ſtrength and vital heat be preſerved during the courſe of the Diſeaſe in due tune and ſtate, gives in precept firſt an apt kind of food, and moreover Cardiac and Anodyne remedies, and thoſe which ſeaſonably occur to other ſymptomes, if perhaps they ariſe. Firſt, in a true Pleuriſie, a moſt thin Diet ought to be appointed, <hi>viz.</hi> of meer Oatmeal and Barley; and for ordinary drink, a Ptiſan or Poſſet-drink rather than Beer
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:40331:150"/> alone is convenient: although in an outragious thirſt this alſo is to be allowed of in a moderate quantity.

Secondly,<note place="margin">Cardiacks.</note> let only the tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Cordials be adminiſtred which mildly do recreate the animal ſpirits, and not at all intend the kindling of the blood, burning out of its due proportion. For theſe intentions, the water of <hi>Carduus Mariae, Carduus Benedictus,</hi> of Balm, Borage, Cowſlips, Black-cherries, are uſually given with ſucceſs: whereto let the powder of Pearls and Coral be added. Thirdly, It behoveth to adminiſter Anodynes, both inwardly, to provoke ſleep in caſe it be very much wanting, and alſo externally, to alleviate the pain of the ſide. Of the former kinde the more uſual are the diſtill'd water, ſyrup and powder of red Poppies, which are eſteemed Specificks in a Pleuriſie and in a Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pneumonie: Moreover, when the pain is very acute,<note place="margin">Anodynes.</note> and watchings inſtant upon the patient, they may lawfully drink Diacodiates.

Any one labouring with an Impoſthume or ulcer of the Lungs, although he do ſpit out abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant and foetid matter (as it frequently happens in an Impoſthume of the Lungs,) is not therefore accounted obnoxious to an Empyema. For in truth, by the common acceptation of this Term is ſignified a Collection of rotten matter within the cavity of the Thorax, by which the Organs of breathing are oppreſſed: but that rotten matter is wont to have a conflux thither either by a Pleuriſie or Peripneumonie, (and ſometimes perhaps from a Squinancy) brought firſt to ſuppuration and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards broke.</p>

                           <note place="margin">It rarely or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver begins of it ſelf.</note>Foraſmuch as an Empyema never begins primarily and of it ſelf, but for the moſt part is the effect or product of other diſeaſes, not duely cured, it will not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to make much inquiſition about the cauſes thereof. The formal reaſon or conjunct cauſe thereof is known well enough, (to wit) it is a purulent matter, poured out from the Pleura, or the Lungs, or the Larinx, into the cavity of the Thorax. But the other proper cauſes of the previous effects, appertain to the Etiologies of every of them.</p>

                           <note place="margin">What the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bific matter is.</note>There is a certain diſpute about the morbific matter; for ſome contend that it is meer corruption, others not that, but that it is a purulent matter, of which opinion is <hi>Johannes Heurnius,</hi> who averring a purulent matter for the conjunct cauſe of an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyema, diſtinguiſhes between this and mere and pure Pus, affirming this to come to paſs <hi>from a bloody nutritious humour,</hi> i. e. <hi>from the blood it ſelf ſomewhat corrupted, but ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of digeſtion, but that a purulent matter is an excrementitious humour,</hi> viz. <hi>a Serum or Ichor,</hi> which proceeds from the blood obſtructed and hindered ſomewhere in its Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. From hence we may obſerve concerning an Impoſthume which affords true and laudable <hi>Pus</hi> or matter, that it is for the moſt part compact, every way ſhut up and wrapt up together either in a bladder, or (as it were) within private Apartments, and then after it is maturated and broken, pours out the contained humour, and is ſoon and eaſily healed.<note place="margin">The difference of Pus and a puru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent matter.</note> But an Impoſthume affording a purulent matter forms its neſt not ſo bound up and encompaſs'd with walls, but for the moſt part unequal and crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and being broken rather pours out filthy blood or gore than matter or Pus, and then by reaſon of the ſucceſſive ſource of excrementitious humour, it is very difficult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly healed.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, we are to conſider, that each humour as well Pus as purulent matter doth ſometimes ſtink notably, and is alſo ſometimes very free from any bad ſavour. Some maturated and broken Impoſthumes pour out fetid matter, others matter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſmell. I have often obſerv'd Impoſthumes of the Lungs, as well as Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of other parts to have this ſeveral diſtinction. Purulent matter from many Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers ſtinks ill;<note place="margin">Why both ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with, and ſometimes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtench.</note> the Spittle of conſumptive perſons which is eſteemed to be very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, for the moſt part is without any ſcent. It is uſual where the ſide is opened by reaſon of an Empyema, that at firſt the matter flows out not unſweet, but after two or three days the air having more frequently enter'd into the orifice, it ſtinks moſt horribly: which ſtench notwithſtanding after an injection of ſome aromatical or vinous Spirit vaniſhes again in a ſhort ſpace. But it would be a thing of much te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſs
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:40331:152"/> to denote the particular reaſons of each of theſe accidents and alterations, for that never ſo little alteration of the Pus or purulent matter, both cauſes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves the ſtench from them. When the ſulphureous particles are equally digeſted, and being ſubjugated to the ſalts are contained in a mixture, there is no ſtench; but as ſoon as they being looſed begin to fly away, and carry the ſalt particles with them (whereby they are ſharpened) they diſperſe a very bad ſtench round about. But whereas an Injection or Lotion with vinous and aromatical liquors, being ſometimes adminiſtred to a putrid Ulcer or neſt of an Empyema, frequently removes all ſtench; the reaſon is, becauſe the ſides of an Ulcer, no otherwiſe than as a ſtinking pot, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the contained liquor as with a certain ferment, and ſo impreſſe a ſtink: but when that ferment of the veſſel or bowel is waſhed or overcome by a well-tempered and ſtrong liquor, then that propagation of a ſtench ceaſeth. From hence follows not always an ill ſign, nor is it ſo very good, if the Spittle of conſumptive perſons, and the Impoſthumes of ſuch as are Empyematical are excerned either with, or without ſtench; for that I have known it to have been to ſome healthful, and to others deadly in either caſe. Moreover a more certain Judgment is not to be taken from thence, that the ſpittle of ſome conſumptive perſons floats upon the water, and that of others ſinks.</p>
                        <p>But although we do not much diſapprove of that diſtinction of Pus and purulent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, notwithſtanding we adjudge neither only this, nor always that,<note place="margin">Neither the cauſe of an Empyema.</note> to be a conjunct cauſe of an Empyema. Whenas this diſeaſe ſucceeding a ſimple Pleuriſie, ariſes from an Impoſthume being ſuppurated and broken in the ſide, it is moſt commonly pure and meer Pus, which falling into the cavity of the breaſt, engenders that diſeaſe. But if an Empyema be an Offspring of a Peripneumonie (unleſs an Impoſthume of the Lungs intervene) the ichorous matter being accumulated about the place of the phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and after thickening by meer concoction, it wounds the Lungs, and at length making a hole through the membrane encompaſſing it, and flowing out into the Thorax, produces an Empyema. That matter is rather to be accounted purulent than meer Pus.</p>

Some foregoing diſeaſes are eſteemed of the former ſort, whoſe iſſue this uſes to be, of which ſort are the Pleuriſie, Peripneumonie, and Squinancy, alſo ſometimes a ſtroke or wound of the breaſt, and ſometimes other diſtempers thereof, not well cured, nor diſcharged; out of which the ſuſpicion will be greater of an Empyema to enſue, if after one or two weeks without abundant Spittle, the ſhiver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an Ague and fainting of the Spirits overtakes one.

                        <p>An Empyema is diſtinguiſhed many ways, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt according to the diſtemper going before, whoſe Offspring it is; alſo according to its ſeat, one while in the right ſide of the breaſt, another while in the left, and another while in the whole capacity thereof; and laſtly, as to the morbific matter, which is either meer and laudable pus, or purulent matter, and this one while gentle, and benigne, and another while ſharp and ſtinking.</p>

If an Empyema ſucceeds more ſlow, after the firſt diſtemper, to wit not before the thirtieth or fortieth day, whenas the ſtrength is very much worn, and the Lungs are vitiated, and their ſtructure hurt; and alſo if a feaver remain as it were hectick, the breathing ſhort and painful, the Pulſe weak and quick, with cold ſweat, and with a Diarrhea or waſting looſneſs, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent faintings of the Spirits, then the ſtate of ſuch a perſon being evidently deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, doth not admit of any opening; let a Phyſician ſuffer him to dye without bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, leſt he ſeem to murder him. But if on the contrary, after manifeſt ſigns of an Empyema more maturely perfected, the painfulneſs of the Lungs or ſide, as alſo the feaver and other ſymptomes abate, and the Pulſe, and ſtrength of the Spirits are in vigour, it will be lawfull ſafely to advance to cutting, and thereby to hope a happy ſucceſs. Inciſion being made, if white Pus duly concocted or otherwiſe laudable skip out with eaſe, and thence the heavineſs of the breaſt and difficult breathing
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:40331:153"/> abate, and the patient is better as to the other paſſions, there will not the leaſt doubt remain of his cure: but if no Pus, or that which is bad, if thin, ſomething bloody, or ſtinking, flow from the ſide being opened, we can conceive thereby but ſmall hope of recovery.</p>

He whoſe ſide was opened, had Lungs ſound enough; but from the Impoſthume of the ſide being broke inwardly, the matter falling into the cavity of the Thorax did ſo compreſs the Diaphragma that he could ſcarcely breathe.

                           <note place="margin">The morbifick matter.</note>The uſual matter of an Impoſthume of the Lungs is meer Pus, which often ſtinks notably, and by that differs from the Spittle which is ejected in a Peripneumonie or a Conſumption of the Lungs. But whence that matter proceeds in the beginning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and of what diſpoſition it was before it was ripened into pus, I cannot ſo eaſily determine: becauſe the ſeeds of this diſeaſe being privily ſow'd, and growing up ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly, ſpring wholly from an occult original; wherefore its procatarctick or more remote cauſes lye conceal'd, yea while it begins and increaſes, can neither be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by any pathognomical Signs, nor can any prognoſtick be deviſed, before it diſcovers it ſelf with a mortal ſtroak, but the whole procedure thereof is treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</p>
                        <p>Now if after the Impoſthume is broke, and the ſpitting up of pus with an eaſie diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge being begun, with a conſtancy of ſtrength, there be means offer'd for ſome method of cure, the chief Indications according to the common cuſtom in moſt diſeaſes will be theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Curatory, preſervatory, and vital.

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:40331:155"/> preſcrib'd for an Empyema after inciſion, and alſo the ſame diet as was ordain'd in a beginning conſumption; beſides, in this caſe Aſſes-milk often-times doth much good. As to the curing this diſeaſe, I have obſerved, that an Iſſue made in the ſide, for the moſt part doth ſignally profit. I remember two ſuffering under this diſtemper, by coughing up plentifully mere ſtinking Pus or Corruption after the Impoſthume broke, to have been heal'd by this Remedy in a ſhort ſpace of time. The Hiſtories of the Cures ſhall be afterwards annexed.<note place="margin">Fontinels in the ſide very often greatly help in this diſeaſe.</note> In both theſe by a ſhallow orifice made in the ſide by inciſion, meer Pus began within three or four days to flow out, and then the Spittle began to be abated; and after that flowing, encreaſed from day to day, for ſome time continued, the Spittle altogether ceaſed, and the Patent recovered his entire health.</p>
                        <p>The reaſon of this admirable Effect ſeems to be, that the part affected of the Lungs, or that which is bordering upon it, while the diſeaſe was ariſing, or before, grew to the very ſide, and therefore Nature had endeavoured by this way the thruſting forth of the Pus or matter contained in the Impoſthume; and for that cauſe perhaps had made ſecret paſſages even to the ſuperficies of the ſide; wherefore, afterwards an iſſue being laid open by a knife, the excretion of the morbific matter was conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thither. It is alſo probable, that a certain part of the Lobe of the Lungs at firſt grew to the ſide in the diſeaſed, and by reaſon of the cleaving thereto, afterwards the Impoſthume had its riſe; for whereas that part being almoſt immoveable, could not be ſtirred like to the other parts of the Lungs, the morbific matter was depoſited there, and was the better able to reſide or form its neſt there.</p>
                        <p>Although the Impoſthume of the Lungs be thought a very rare diſtemper with ſome Phyſicians, and by <hi>Tulpius</hi> judg'd ſo mortal, that when it breaks it kills out right; yet I have known many to have labour'd under this diſeaſe, and by the help of Medicines to have recovered their priſtine health. We may here deſcribe two or three of the more remarkable Hiſtories of them.</p>
                        <p>A Gentleman of a middle age, and before ſtrong and continually healthful, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf not well, without any apparent cauſe, contracted as it were a crazie diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; for being without pain, without Vomit, Cough or notable Feaver, in a ſhort time grown weak, he became without any appetite, unapt to ſleep, full of thirſt and hot about the precordia; this perſon was handled a long while by ſome Phyſicians as Scorbutical, and by others as hectical; and after various methods of healing were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay'd in vain, at length the diſeaſe ſallying out as from an ambuſh, appeared manifeſtly. For whilſt on a certain night being more unquiet than uſual, he toſſed himſelf very much in his bed, all on a ſudden the Impoſthume breaking in his Lungs, a large quantity of ſtinking pus was thrown out by Cough, ſo that in four or five hours he threw off about two pints. Moreover, after his Cough continuing about two months, he daily ſpit out purulent matter, thick and very ſtinking, untill his fleſh being conſumed, and he wholly ſpent, was reduced to languiſhing, and a notable Conſumption. From the ſtench of his Spittle and breath the whole Chamber was ſo filled, that his Servants or thoſe attending him, could not endure the ill ſcent thereof.</p>
                        <p>After the Impoſthume was thus broken, I and two other well-known Phyſicians being adviſed with, with all circumſpection we preſcribed Medicines to abſterge and heal the Impoſthume, and to cleanſe the Blood and Lungs, and to redeem him from an imminent Conſumption. <hi>A Tincture, and ſyrup of Sulphur, together with Pectoral and Vulnerary Decoctions and Diſtillations were taken; alſo Lohochs and balſamick Pills, day after day in a conſtant courſe, with Clyſters, gentle Purgatives and Diureticks, were taken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween whiles:</hi> then theſe, <hi>Vaporations and Fumigations, as well ſulphureous as arſenical, were uſed morning and evening.</hi> After theſe things being long and carefully uſed did help nothing, I often propounded the opening of the Thorax; but the ſick man ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately rejecting this operation, ſaid he would rather dye than be murdered; yet at length, when I aſſured him that this remedy, or none, was further to be attempted, he began to deliberate with himſelf, and immediately baring his breaſt, he ſuffered me to ſearch a place where I might apply a Cauterie; the buſineſs was preſently put out of doubt, for a Tumour appeared on the left ſide of the Sternon, between the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Vertebra. Inſtead of a Cautery, I applyed thereto a ſuppurating Plaiſter, and within three dayes the top of that ſwelling became red and ſoft: out of which, being the next day opened, firſt a thin ichor, and a little after a yellow and concocted pus flowed out, and afterwards it continued daily to ſtream out more plentifully: from
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:40331:155"/> that time his ſtinking Spittle began to abate, and within fourteen days it ceaſed quite; the morbific matter obtaining through that orifice both an eaſie and more convenient iſſue. Although by the effect it was manifeſt, that the paſſage of that orifice lay open into the breaſt, and perhaps into the middle of the Lungs, yet no liquor caſt in by a Syringe, could either penetrate or be forced in thither: ſo ſecret and intricate are the conveyances which Nature forms for her laſt aids; that by the ſame paſſage by which the morbific matter is exterminated, nothing more hurtful can enter. This opening of the ſide was at length chang'd into an Iſſue, and a Peaſe or a wooden pill being put in, there came forth daily for half a year together plentifull ichor; and in the mean time this well-known perſon, all corruption of the breaſt being ſhook off, and the fleſhy habit of his body being recovered, became healthful in all reſpects, and laſtly, that iſſue being removed to his arm, he bears no ſign of that nor any other diſeaſe in his breaſt.</p>
                        <p>After this Cure ſo by chance accompliſhed, it hapned I performed another like it, on purpoſe, not leſs ſucceſſefully; for ſhortly I was ſent for to a noble Lady which had been for many years obnoxious to the heat of the precordia with a Cough. One day, when ſhe coughed ſhe was throughly ſenſible of ſomething broke in her Lungs, and preſently ſhe voided abundance of meer pus, and that ſtinking; after that, this kind of Spittle continuing with a Cough, for a week, notwithſtanding the uſe of remedies, ſeemed rather augmented than diminiſhed, I adviſed to have an Iſſue cut in her ſide, near the very place whence ſhe perceived the pus to aſcend, which ſhe readily granted: Within three days, from the orifice being opened meer pus began to flow out, like that ſhe diſcharged by Cough. Then after the mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>After this I was ſent for to another, <hi>viz.</hi> a ſtrong man, and as ſtrong a drinker; who being affected with an Impoſthume of the Lungs, alſo ſpit up an abundance of pus and very ſtinking matter. This Patient by a certain rude contumacy abhorr'd any iſſue, wherefore he would not ſuffer any to be made in his ſide; notwithſtanding he took any Medicines offered to him, by a long uſe of which Remedies he eſcaped free from that diſeaſe: the Medicines whereby he chiefly received help were prepared of Sulphur, as our Syrup and Tincture, taken daily and very frequently. To theſe for Vehicles were added one while a Decoction, another while a pectoral Hydromel, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while Lime-water, with an infuſion of pectoral, as well as vulnerary Ingredients. Moreover Fumigations and Smokes, eſpecially of ſulphureous and arſenical Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients, did contribute very notable help.</p>

A convulſive Aſthma (which we judged to be the ſecond kind of this diſeaſe,<note place="margin">A convulſive Aſthma.</note> and to be raiſed without any great obſtruction or compreſſion of the Bronchia, from the mere Cramps of the moving fibres) is not limited to one place, or to any peculiar organ, but being of a diffuſed energy, it is extended to almoſt all the parts employed in breathing (whereof one while this, another while that, or ſome other is in fault.<note place="margin">Its Seat mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold and diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</note>) For a convulſive affection inciting an Aſthmatical invaſion, hath regard to the moving fibres of the veſſels of the Lungs, to the Diaphragma, to the muſcles of the breaſt, to the Nerves, which belong unto the Breaſt, or Lungs, nay to the origine of thoſe Nerves planted within the Brain; and whileſt the morbific matter dwells in every of theſe places, hindering or perverting the work of breathing, it brings on the fits of this Diſeaſe, as in another Tract we have ſomewhile ſince plainly demonſtrated. For the animal Spirits deſtin'd to the function of breathing, if at any time they are very much moleſted and conſtrained into irregular motions, enter inordinately into the Fibres as well nervous as moving of the organs of breathing, and make them for that cauſe one while to be contracted, another while to be diſtended irregularly, as alſo their ſolemn and equal turns of Syſtole and Diaſtole to be variouſly diſturbed or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
                        <p>The morbific cauſe or matter provoking the Spirits prepared for the pneumonic work, as in divers places, ſo chiefly in theſe three,<note place="margin">The morbific matter conſiſts in ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> is wont to advance its force or power, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Either in the muſcular fibres themſelves, or 2. In the branches or nervous ſlips, or laſtly within the Brain by the origine of the Nerves.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. As to the former,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>1.</hi> In the muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular fibres.</note> the heterogene matter being inimical to the Spirits is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſhaken off from the Brain into the trunks of the Nerves, and from thence by their paſſages and ſlips, if perhaps it ſhall be in very little quantity, without very great or ſenſible hurt ſlides down to their lower ends. And when it falls in the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous fibres, and being heaped up daily, ſhall at length ſenſibly increaſe unto a great quantity, it begins to trouble the inmate Spirits, and to provoke them into aſthmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Convulſions; which forthwith infeſt, and are encreaſed by reaſon of evident cauſes, neither do they utterly ceaſe, untill the ſtock of matter ſo accumulated, be wholly diſpers'd, and conſumed; afterwards when it being renewed ariſes to a fulneſs, the fits of that diſeaſe return, and are for that cauſe moſt frequently periodical, as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to common obſervation. According to this account we do deſervedly ſuſpect the cauſe of a convulſive aſthma ſometimes to lurk in the muſcular coats of the pneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monick veſſels, alſo ſometimes in the fibres of the Diaphragma, or the Proceſſes thereof towards the loyns. It is not very probable that the neſt of this diſeaſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts within the fibres of this or that pectoral muſcle, although in Scorbutical perſons from theſe alſo poſſeſſed with a convulſive matter, we have known pains to have riſen with breathing being hurt.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. But truly (even as in another place we have not only demonſtrated by reaſon,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>2.</hi> Within the Nerves and their enfold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</note> but by the obſervations and Hiſtories of the ſick) a convulſive aſthma is often incurred, as often as the morbific matter ſliding down into the pneumonic Nerves, ſticks in
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:40331:157"/> ſome place within their paſſages, and eſpecially about their foldings: whence as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as it is accumulated to a plenitude it begins to be mov'd and ſhaken; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſpirits lying lurking, and flowing into the organs of breathing diſturbed, are forced into irregularity, and thoſe ſpirits preſently affect other inmates of the fibres of the Lungs and breaſt, and provoke them into unequal and aſthmatical convulſions. For this cauſe and the reaſon of the diſturbance, we have declared that not only invaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this diſeaſe, but alſo the precordia being diſturb'd thereby the Cardiack paſſions do ariſe.</p>

We have clearly unfolded by anatomical obſervations that the cauſe of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive Aſthma ſometimes conſiſts in the hinder part of the head near the origines of the nerves. Surely I have obſerv'd ſome patients, who when, lying ſick of other deſperate diſeaſes, they were alſo aſthmatick, found it neceſſary to be whether in bed or chair with their head always erect, or looking down, but lying on their back or leauing backwards incontinently they gaped for breath as if they were dying, and hardly breathed; the cauſe whereof (as appear'd by diſſection after they were dead) was only a huge collection of ſharp Serum which was gather'd within the cavities of the brain; which, if by reaſon of the head inclining backwards, it fell into the origine of the Nerves of the eighth pair, preſently the precordia, and chiefly the breathing organs were affected with horrid cramps. Moreover ſometimes for this very reaſon it ſeeme that Orthopnoick perſons cannot lie down in their bed without danger of choaking, but are conſtrain'd to ſit up with an erect body.</p>

Although an Aſthma is ſometimes ſimple from the beginning, <hi>viz.</hi> either merely pneumonical, or convulſive, notwithſtanding after either diſeaſe hath for ſome time encreaſed, for the moſt part it gains the other to it ſelf: hence it may be concluded every inveterate Aſthma to be a mixt affection, ſtirr'd up by the default partly of the Lungs ill fram'd, and partly by default of the Nerves and nervous fibres appertaining to the breathing parts. For when the pneumonic paſſages being ſtraitned or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed from ſome cauſe, do not admit of a free ſucking in, and breathing out of the air, for that cauſe alſo the blood, yea and nervous humour, being hindred in their courſes, and compell'd to proceed ſlowly and to ſtagnate, do faſten their feculency and dregs upon the nervous parts; whence the paſſages of the ſpirits are obſtructed, or perverted, and at length a convulſive taint accrues to them. Moreover the blood, being not duly inſpir'd and eventilated within the precordia, at length being viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in its temperament ſupplies the brain and nervous ſtock but with a depraved juice, whoſe faults do chiefly puniſh the organs of reſpiration before hurt and debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litated. In like manner alſo the evil is reciprocrated on the contrary part, as oft as this diſeaſe begins by fault of the nervous ſtock; for as much as the motion of the Lungs is often ſtopt or hindered, by reaſon of Convulſions in the muſcular fibres, both the blood and the nervous juice being reſtrain'd from their uſual motions, do heap up dregs and filths, faſtening them to the parts containing them, by which not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly viſcous humours and obſtructing of the paſſages, but even Tumours and other more ſolid concretes vitiating the ſtructure of the Lungs, are produced.</p>

For this very reaſon the diſeaſed do find themſelves better in Summer, when they breath more freely, than in Winter; likewiſe better in hot countries than in cold, the South or Weſt wind blowing, than the North or Eaſt.</p>
                        <p>Of the curatory method of an Aſthma there will be two chief indications,<note place="margin">Two chief In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications.</note> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo many diſtinct methods of healing, <hi>viz.</hi> Curatory and preſervatory. The firſt inſtructs what is to be perform'd in the fit it ſelf, that the Patient may be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from preſent danger; the other, by what out of the fit, we ought to endeavour the taking away the morbiſick cauſe, leſt that diſtemper be repeated more often, or more heavily.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Therefore a fit urging, there will be two chief intentions of curing, <hi>viz.</hi> firſt,<note place="margin">What is to be done in the fit.</note> that a more free breathing be procured, as well upon the account of air, as of the Lungs, at leaſt ſo far, as may ſuffice to ſupport life; and ſecondly, that the organs of breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may be withdrawn, and reſtrain'd, as ſoon as may be, from the Convulſions begun, and uſually obſtinately continuing.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. As to what reſpects the former,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>1</hi> Intention to facilitate breathing.</note> let the Patient be placed in an upright poſition of body, in a more open place, and pretty airy, free from Smoak and breath of by ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; then let it be indeavoured that the Lungs, being made free from all obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and inward oppreſſion, and alſo external compreſſion, may be able to draw and change the breath more eaſily. For theſe purpoſes leſt the bulk of the nether bowels compreſs or ſtraiten the precordia, the belly is to be looſen'd by a Clyſter, the apparel and what ever binds about the Breaſt to be looſened; alſo when in this caſe either from the blood ſwelling up inordinately within the Pneumonic veſſels, or from the Serum diſtilling out of the Arteries and Glandules into the tracheal paſſages, they are wont to be oppreſſed, the impetuoſity and inſtigations of either humour ought to be reſtraind and appeaſed; inſomuch that if ſtrength endure, and the pulſe be ſtrong enough, Phlebotomy is oftentimes convenient. Moreover thoſe things are carefully to be adminiſtred which diſpatch away the Serum and ſuperfluities of the boiling blood by urine, as well as ſweatings: to which intention, Juleps, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zemes, commonly call'd Pectorals, do notably conduce; yea, powders of ſhells, mille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But theſe may not be exhibited without great circumſpection, becauſe whereas more or leſs they hinder breathing (which already is difficult and too much hindred) they frequently bring the Patient into danger of life. Beſides this, that the Pneumo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic ſpirits may be diverted from their Convulſions, it is many times expedient to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt the ſpirits in other places; for ſome of the ſpirits being in other places afflicted moſt commonly the reſidue as well as thoſe that are ſmitten do diſmiſs their irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities: Wherefore Veſicatories, Cupping-glaſſes, ligatures, and painful frictions bring

                           </gap>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations were applied to the place pained, yet without any great ſucceſs or eaſe: for the alteration which happened afterwards declined rather to worſe; for a difficult and obſtructed breath came upon the pain's growing a little more remiſs, ſo that from his firſt ſleep, or inclination thereto he became aſthmatical and gaping for breath, and ſuffering about the precordia he was conſtrained to ſit upright in his bed. Moreover a dyſpnoea of this kind and a convulſive agitation of the breathing parts did not only return every evening, but from day to day were rendred more outragious and laſted a longer time; inſomuch that one night waking from his ſleep, for many hours he was aſſaulted with a moſt painful fit of an Aſthma which had almoſt kill'd him. The Phyſicians being at a great diſtance from him, although deſired about midnight came not while the morning following, mean while by reaſon of bleeding uſed by a Barber this worthy Gentleman revived, being redeemed from the jaws
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:40331:159"/> of death; but afterwards by the conſultations of Phyſitians that day a ſlender diet and looſening the belly by a Clyſter were preſcribed: In the evening and early in the morning he took of Spirit of gum Ammoniac diſtilled with ſal Armoniac 12 drops in a proper vehicle, and continued the uſe for many days after; Veſicatories were applyed on the inſide of his arms near the armpits; moreover Juleps and pectoral Decoctions, Lohochs, Clyſters, and alſo mild Purges were taken by turns; alſo Phlebotomie was repeated after two days. Whereas formerly he was uſed to drink for his mornings draught a pint of Ale with Wormwood and Scurvy-graſs, in the room of that about eight a clock he took 15 drops of Elixir Proprietatis tartariz'd in a draught of Coffee made with Sage. By theſe remedies his aſthmatical fits preſently abated of their fierceneſs, inſomuch that the beginning and end of every night were quiet enough, but in the middle light troubles about the precordia kept him from ſleep, ſitting upright an hour or two. Certain other medicines were propounded by the Phyſitians, and others of diverſe ſorts privately offered by his friends, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Honourable Perſon utterly rejected, or ſoon loath'd; and that the rather, becauſe, winter then being almoſt ſpent, his reſtauration was hoped for by the coming on of the Spring and enjoyment of the Country air without the help of much Phyſick. Wherefore of the medicines above mentioned he uſed one while this and another while that a little by turns, and ſometimes kept holy-day from them all; but in the interim although his aſthmatical invaſions little or nothing troubled him as formerly in the night, yet by reaſon his Lungs were very much obſtructed, and a ſerous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour fallen down into his feet, he was not able to walk faſt or aſcend ſteep places, without a painful dyſpnoea, being in danger of choaking; and now (while I am writing this) not ſo much an Aſthma or Conſumption, as a Dropſie is feared.</p>

But yet concerning the cauſe of this Diſeaſe, and manner of coming to paſs, to wit, by what ways, and after what manner diſpoſed, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulation of water firſt begins within the hollow of the breaſt, as alſo how it is ſenſibly augmented, and frequently inſenſibly continued untill the Diſeaſe becomes deſperate, is a thing yet in the dark. Whenas there is a general diſtemper of a Dropſie or an Anaſarca appearing, and hath ſeized on the fleſh and cavities of the bowels every where, or in moſt places, we are not to admire if that illuvies of waters ſeize alſo upon the Pectorals: But beſides, ſometimes it happens, that the Region of the Thorax, is either firſt or only overflown, the other parts in the mean time remaining ſound enough, or only hurt ſecondarily.</p>

                           <note place="margin">Its cauſe is hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</note>About the origine of this Diſeaſe, and the manner of generation it is much diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted whence, and by what paſſages that illuvies of water being found every where in the hollowneſs of the Thorax, doth come thither. Some Authors do derive it from above, <hi>viz.</hi> that it deſcends from the head by the Trachea; and others deducing its Spring from beneath, from the cavity of the Abdomen, alſo ſometimes from the Liver and Spleen, by I know not what blind ways, judge thoſe waters to be conveyed into the hollowneſs of the Breaſt. But neither of theſe Opinions challenge our aſſent, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve our arguments to diſprove them: for none conſidering the paſſage of the blood and humours will acknowledge either this or that way of commerce. We cannot but affirm, that the ſerous humour, raiſing a Dropſie of the breaſt, does arrive thither either in a kind of vapour, which being exhal'd from the Precordia and ſides of the Thorax, is eaſily condenſed into water;<note place="margin">How many wayes it may be produced.</note> or ſecondly, that the Serum is there depoſited under its own proper form, inaſmuch as it flows into that cavity from the mouths of the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, <hi>i. e.</hi> of the Arteries being open. We will anon enquire whether the Lymphaducts or veſſels bringing chyle, being any where open, or broke, do ſometimes produce that diſeaſe.</p>

                              <hi>1.</hi> By Vapours condenſed there.</note>1. As to the former, it is ſo very probable that a Dropſie of the breaſt takes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times its origine from vapours condenſed within its cavity, that it is a wonder how it ſhould be otherwiſe at any time, or that any ſhould live exempt from ſuch an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. For how much is there of vapour that ſeparates from the boyling blood? and when it waxes cold in the precordia, how can it come otherwiſe to paſs but that the abundant vapour ſhould be condenſed in this encloſure into water, even as if ſhut with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a Still? And truly it will not be eaſie to determine, when the vaporous ſteams are ſo unceſſantly heaped within the cavity of the breaſt, what may become of them, how they are conſumed, or from thence diſcharged abroad. Surely we muſt affirm, they either penetrate the ſides of the Thorax, or (which rather ſeems to be) they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate into the pores of the Lungs, and ſo fly away in breathing. Certainly by either way, the vapours of the breaſt may exhale: and perhaps if either be defective, or hindred, by that means a Dropſie of the Breaſt may be cauſed.</p>

But moreover, I am apt to think, that this Diſeaſe alſo ſometimes happens in another manner (inaſmuch as the Serum diſtills from the veſſels in its proper form.) For in a cacochymical conſtitution of body, or a perſon very ſcorbutical, where the watery and weak blood every where caſts off its ſuperfluous Serum from its own conſiſtence, and every where ejecting it from the little mouths of the Arteries being looſed and open, excludes it from the clew of circulation, nothing is more uſual, than for the cavities not only of the Bowels,<note place="margin">Which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times breaks out from the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries.</note> but alſo of the Precordia, yea the Brain it ſelf, to be overflown with that watery collection; moreover in ſo general a diſpoſition to a Dropſie, that one while this region, another while that, or another ſhould be firſt and almoſt onely poſſeſs'd; and that alſo ſometimes the inmoſt parts being untoucht,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:40331:160"/> the outward fleſh, <hi>viz.</hi> the muſcles and their interſpaces are overflown with that ſerous illuvies.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Among the veſſels that pour in the dropſical matter into the cavity of the breaſt,<note place="margin">3. And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times from the Lymphaducts.</note> the Lymphaducts and parts bringing the chyle, do juſtly fall under a ſuſpicion. What relates to the former, it appears by anatomical inſpection, that a great company of theſe do creep thorough the whole Lungs, and do tend from their outer parts, ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out themſelves inwards towards the paſſages of the breaſt, and for the moſt part pour out into them their liquour, which being ſuperfluous, they every where ſuck up from the arterious Blood. Therefore whenas theſe veſſels are obſtructed, or are by any means impeded from diſcharging their function, it muſt needs be that a heap of water be accumulated in the Lungs, which afterwards falling into the cavity of the breaſt, will excite a Dropſie in that region. For in truth, this Lympha reſtagnating within the conſiſtence of the Lungs, it often happens that the little bladders called Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datides, in the outer ſuperficies of the Viſcera are raiſed up, which afterwards being broke, diſcharging the waters into the cavities of the Thorax, they produce there an Aſcites. A diſtemper of this kinde is often diſcovered in Sheep, when they dye by heaps of a Dropſie, by reaſon of a moiſt ſeaſon and watery paſture.<note place="margin">A remarkable hiſtory of the like caſe.</note> And ſurely the following Hiſtory doth clearly ſeem to argue, that the Aſcites of the breaſt proceeds from the like cauſe ſometimes in a man, (there being yet a living example of this diſeaſe.) Lately a young man healthful enough and ſtrong, having accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf to hunting and inſatiable riding, and other exerciſes of the body very immoderate, a while without detriment, at length he perceived a fulneſs in his Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax as if it were a kind of ſwelling; inſomuch that the left ſide of his Lungs ſeem'd to begin to ſwell, and his heart to be thruſt out of its place towards the right ſide; for that he perceived the pulſation thereof to be on that part chiefly. After he had been for ſome time in this condition, on a certain day he felt as if a Veſſel had been burſt aſunder within the cavity of the Thorax, and from thence for the ſpace of half an hour, in that place, as it were the dropping of a humour falling from above into the bottome of his breaſt, was not only felt by himſelf, but could be heard alſo by the ſtanders by. Although he was at firſt ſurprized with the rarity of this affect, yet for that he was well enough as to ſtrength, appetite, ſleep, and other natural functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, immediately after he became ſecure, and negligent of Medicines; But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by any motion, bending or ſtirring of his Body, a fluctuation of water ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered within on his left ſide, was felt by him; moreover, the motion and ſound was evidently perceived by others, either by handling, or by the ear. As without doubt this Gentleman was affected with a Dropſie of the Breaſt, ſo it ſeemed moſt probable that the diſeaſe had its original from thence, in regard the lymphaducts relating to the left ſide of the lungs, being firſt obſtructed near their inſertions into the paſſage bringing the chyle, did ſwell up to a great bulk, and afterwards being broken di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill'd their humour into the cavity of the Thorax.</p>
                        <p>When now an Inundation of the Precordia, and ſo of the vital Fort, was imminent,<note place="margin">The reaſon thereof.</note> this Gentleman at length, thinking it time to provide for himſelf, entered into a courſe of Phyſick, and carryed certain Medicines into the Countrey for his cure, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſignal ſucceſs. Afterwards coming to <hi>London,</hi> he firſt conſulted the worthy Dr. <hi>Lower,</hi> being of his former acquaintance. He propoſing the opening of the Thorax for his only remedy, took care that the worthy Dr. <hi>Micklethwait</hi> and my ſelf ſhould be ſent for to the conſultation.<note place="margin">The Cure by a Paracenteſis of the breaſt.</note> Immediately an inciſion was appointed by the conſent of us all: wherefore, after proviſion for the whole being made, a Chirurgeon apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Cautery between the ſixth and ſeventh Vertebra, and the next day he put his Pipe into the Orifice cut into the cavity of his Breaſt; which being done, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a thick liquor whitiſh like Chyle, and as it were milkie, flowed out. There was about ſix ounces only taken from him the firſt time, and the next day as much more. The third day when a little greater quantity was ſuffered to come out, being affected immediately with great fainting, and afterwards being feaveriſh, he was ill for a day or two. Wherefore it ſeemed good to ſtop the iſſue of that matter till he recovered his temperament and ſtrength: but afterwards a ſparing evacuation of the ſame mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being daily made, the cavity of his breaſt was wholly emptyed: but as yet he wears a pipe in the orifice with a tap, which being opened once in a day and a nights ſpace, a very little of the humour flows out; in the mean while, being well in ſtomach, viſage, and ſtrength, he walks abroad, rides, and performs all exerciſes he was formerly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:40331:161"/> to, vigorouſly enough. He uſed not (neither was there need of) much medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, only after the Inciſion we adviſed temperate Cordials, <hi>viz.</hi> powder of Pearles, Juleps, and ſometimes Hypnoticks, and afterwards a vulnerary decoction to be taken twice a day.</p>
                        <p>By this method, and theſe forms of Medicines ſometimes continued, this worthy perſon ſeemed to recover his temper, and his ſtrength, and the habit of his body, and his breaſt exempt from the Dropſie. Notwithſtanding he ſtill wore a ſilver Pipe in the orifice of his ſide (out of which ichor daily flowed): and when after ſome months this being withdrawn, the Iſſue was ſhut up, a gathering of the ſame hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour was made within the hollow of his breaſt, perceivable by the ſound and fluctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation thereof: but when that the diſeaſe returning, the ſame medicine was to be uſed, and inciſion of his ſide appointed, (Nature by chance diſcharging the function of a Chirurgeon) the matter being prone to burſt out, and flowing to the place made its own way. He is now neceſſitated (for preventing the illuvies of his Breaſt) to keep that orifice conſtantly open like a ſink.</p>
                        <p>From theſe things I think it manifeſt enough, that an Aſcites of the Breaſt, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ariſes from the lymphatick veſſels burſt aſunder within the Lungs; neither doubt I leſs but that the ſame affection may be cauſed from the chyliferous paſſages being broke within the Thorax; notwithſtanding, this chance ſo rarely happens, that as yet I have not known it by my own obſervation, or others relation. Moreover, it little avails to make inquiſition into the Aetiologie of ſuch a diſeaſe, becauſe it is not only apparently incurable, but in a ſhort time mortal; becauſe the Precordia are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continently overflown by the inundation of the chyle, and alſo the blood and the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal ſpirits being defrauded of their wonted ſupply of nutritious Juice, are immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately diſſolved.</p>

                           <note place="margin">The differences of this diſeaſe.</note>From the various cauſes of this Diſeaſe even now ſet down, it will be eaſie to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect its differences: For firſt a Dropſie of the Breaſt, is either ſimple and primary, peculiar to this Region; or ſecondary, coming upon a general Dropſie, as it is wont often to be in cachectic perſons. Secondly, this Diſeaſe is diſtinguiſhed as to the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces affected, <hi>viz.</hi> foraſmuch as water is either collected in the whole breaſt, or only in one ſide thereof. Thirdly, as to the matter accumulated in a pectoral Aſcites, which one while is limpid and plainly wateriſh, another while more thick, whitiſh, and as it were milkie, ſuch as we have deſcribed in the foregoing Hiſtory.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">The Diagnoſtick ſigns.</note>The diagnoſtick ſigns do manifeſtly enough diſcover this diſeaſe: <hi>viz.</hi> the fluctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of water is perceived by handling, and by feeling at every bending of the body, and the ſound is clearly heard. Moreover they are affected much with a dry and empty Cough, as alſo with a Dyſpnoea almoſt continual and painful, eſpecially while they aſcend ſteep places; Beſides, they have a thirſt, with a little feaver, and in the night after the firſt ſleep, great diſquiet and toſſing of the body, proceeding from the vapours being elevated by the heat being more intenſe. Sometimes there comes upon theſe a Palpitation of the heart, an intermitting or diſturbed Pulſe, and frequent faintings of the ſpirit. As to the prognoſtick, this diſeaſe is always difficult to cure, and among the vulgar accounted incurable. And ſurely if it come upon an Aſcites of the Abdomen or an Anaſarca throughout the whole body, it is judged not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe deſperate; But if the affection be primary, and happen to a body other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſound, we are not altogether to deſpair of Cure.</p>

                           <note place="margin">The Cure.</note>What relates to the curatory part of this Diſeaſe, the chief Indications will be three, Curative, Preſervative, and Vital, according to the common method of curing in moſt other Diſtempers.</p>
                        <p>The firſt has regard that the water heaped up in the cavity of the Breaſt by any means be evacuated. The Second provides, that afterwards a new illuvies be not ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in the ſame place. The Third procures the reſtoration of ſtrength, and the ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms impairing it to be removed with expedition.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">What Intentions of healing the firſt Indication ſuggeſts.</note>To ſatisfie the firſt Indication, and that an Aſcites of the Breaſt may be emptyed, there are but two ways or means of evacuation to be met with, whereby this collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of waters may be drayn'd, <hi>viz.</hi> Either that the veſſels of the Breaſt, and the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of the humours, being emptyed, might ſuck up that Lympha being rarified, and afterwards by the paſſages of the blood or air convey them forth: or ſecondly, that by an inciſion of the ſide, thoſe waters may be drained forth plentifully in their own Species.</p>

                        <p>That former manner although more ſeldom, yet ſometimes ſucceeds;<note place="margin">The firſt Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> which I can atteſt out of my own obſervation. For the conſiſtence of the Lungs being ſpongy within, and externally very porous, while by every turn of the Diaſtole, they are drenched in the underlying waters, they ſometimes imbibe them being turn'd into va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour; and ſo diſpatch them to the blood, or continually exhale them with aire coming out at the mouth. That an effect of this ſort may more eaſily happen to cure this diſeaſe, medicinal aids are taken: For that intention therefore the paſſages of blood, aire, and humours ought to be emptyed as much as may be, and to be kept ſo empty. For this purpoſe, Purges, Diureticks, and more mild Diaphoreticks are methodically, and alternately exhibited; alſo remedies for the breaſt, and expectorating, challenge here their place; let the Diet be ſlender and warming, and a government appointed as to all other things of that nature, that the blood may be made to exhale the more, and all the ſuperfluous humours to evaporate.

                        <p>HItherto we have largely enough unfolded the Pathologie and curatory me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of the Thorax; now it follows next to finiſh our task in like manner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the lower Belly. But we have in our former tract for the moſt part deſcribed already the medicines belonging to this region, and the manner and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of their working, together with the Anatomy of the Stomach and Inteſtines: we have treated of remedies ſtomachical, dyſenterical, and others belonging to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines, as alſo diureticks together with the reaſons of them: Moreover we have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficently elſewhere handled the aetioligie of Hypochondriack, and Hyſterical reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. What therefore remains, of Hepatical diſtempers as well proper, as of thoſe vulgarly aſcrib'd thereunto, and of their remedies we will diſcourſe in this Section; notwithſtanding in each of theſe, we will beſtow more labour, about the curatory, than pathological part.</p>
                        <p>The chief diſeaſes by which the Liver and the appendix thereof,<note place="margin">Diſeaſes of the Liver.</note> are wont to be incumbred, are the Jaundies, and a Tumour, and under this latter many other affects, <hi>viz.</hi> obſtruction, inflammation, induration, and ſchirrus are numbred; to all which are vulgarly appointed remedies commonly called Hepaticks, and which make up a great part of the Diſpenſatory.</p>
                        <p>The Jaundies is either a diſeaſe by it ſelf, primarily beginning, which is here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly treated of: or it is an effect or product of another diſeaſe; as when it ariſes upon an intermitting Feaver, which oftentimes it puts an end to, of which alſo we will preſently treat by the by.</p>
                        <p>An Icterical diſtemper by the common conſent of moſt is judged to ariſe in as much as the yellow choler, not at all, or not enough received,<note place="margin">The Jaundies.</note> from the ends of <hi>vena porta,</hi> into the paſſages of the cholerick pore, overflows into the maſs of blood and pollutes it with its greenneſs, whereby alſo the very skin is diſcolour'd.</p>
                        <p>That obſtruction is wont to happen after many manners and in various places.<note place="margin">The cauſe of it.</note> For ſometimes it happens near the extream ends of either kind of veſſels, <hi>viz.</hi> the end of the <hi>vena porta,</hi> and the <hi>porus bilarius;</hi> the interſpaces whereof happen frequently to be compreſſed, and ſtopt by reaſon of the Parenchyma of the Liver being tume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, or otherwiſe vitiated; wherefore the humour of the gall not being transferred out of the ſeparating veſſels of the <hi>porta</hi> into the other receiving veſſels, turns back upon the blood. Secondly, the paſſage of the humour of the gall is ſometimes intercept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the middle paſſages of the cholerick pore; for that the cavities of theſe are filled either with a viſcous, or ſandy, and ſometimes with a ſtony matter; as is plainly diſcerned in the Livers of beaſts in the winter ſeaſon, while they are fed with hay and ſtraw. Thirdly, it is alſo manifeſt by Anatomical obſervation, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times an obſtruction in the very bladder of the gall, or in the cyſtic paſſage is the cauſe of the Jaundies; for if at any time, it being filled with ſtones, receive not the choler, or being here ſhut up, or grown together, it reſtrains the deſcent of the choler towards the guts, that humour although well ſeparated from the blood, is conſtrained to flow black into the maſs thereof, and ſo propagates the Jaundies.</p>
                        <p>Againſt this moſt received opinion, by which it is judged,<note place="margin">The opinion of <hi>Sylvius</hi> of the cauſe of the Jaundies.</note> that the cauſe of the Jaundies for the moſt part conſiſts on this ſide the <hi>veſica fellis</hi> or about it towards the Liver: the moſt Renowned <hi>Sylvius</hi> altogether places it without this, <hi>viz.</hi> in the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:40331:163"/> Cyſtic or common paſſage. For ſuppoſing the choler not to be ſeparated from the blood, within the paſſages of the Liver, but in the very bladder of the Gall to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated of a humour brought thither by the Arteries; He judged the greateſt part, being carried upwards by the paſſage of the <hi>pori bilarii,</hi> to be poured into the blood for ſome notable uſes, and alſo another part to deſcend beneath to the Inteſtines, alſo for neceſſary uſes: wherefore if this latter ſluce be ſhut, all the choler is carried upwards into the blood, and filling it too much with this humour, perverts it from its genuine temper, into an Icterical.</p>
                        <p>But truly leſt the ſtopping of the paſſage of the bladder, or of the common paſſage, (neither of which eaſily happens, or from any light occaſion) may ſeem leſs effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to excite any Jaundies; therefore, <hi>whether ſuch an obſtruction hath place, or no,</hi> the moſt Renowned man ingeniouſly ſuppoſes beſides, <hi>The choler while it is generated in the bladder does undergo ſometimes a notable change, by which it is moved, and is born about more plentifully and impetuouſly,</hi> towards the blood, <hi>with which yet it is leſs mingled than it was wont to be, but only confounded together with it, and ſo more eaſily departs from it and infects and tinges the ſolid parts with its colour.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But that the <hi>choler in the Jaundies may be rendred unfit to mix with the other humours, or to be nearly united;</hi> he determines it to be done, <hi>by a ſpirit too valatile, mixed plentifully with it, and ſo making it more ſpirituous and immiſcible with others.</hi> He confirms this aſſertion by two inſtances, <hi>viz.</hi> in as much as the moſt ſpirituous poiſon from the biting of a Viper, and the too much uſe of the more generous drinks, <hi>viz.</hi> Wine and Strong-waters, cauſes ſometimes the Jaundies. Moreover he endeavours to procure credit to this Hypotheſis, for that this diſeaſe is wont to be cured, not only by medicines opening obſtructions, but by them which blunt the force of a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging volatile ſalt (of which <hi>ſort are the decoction of Hemp-ſeeds, alſo</hi> Venice <hi>ſoape</hi> with many other things of the ſame ſort.)</p>
                        <p>It belongs not to this place, neither is it to our purpoſe to deſcend to end this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, nor dare I now raſhly determine it (ſince it hath tired ſo many Renowned Wits of the Moderns) whether really the choler be made in the bladder of the Gall, or whether it be only ſeparated from the blood in the Liver, the great organ of ſeparation; I confeſs this latter opinion beſt pleaſes me.<note place="margin">The Authors opinion.</note> And weighing theſe things ſeriouſly I am induced to think the cauſe of the Jaundies to conſiſt chiefly in this, that the choler be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſever'd in the Liver, is not, by reaſon of the ways being obſtructed, at all, or not enough conveyed to the bladder of the Gall, but that it muſt of neceſſity regurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate into the maſs of blood; notwithſtanding in the mean while we deny not, but this affect may ſometime ariſe (although more rarely) from the Cyſtic paſſage or common pipe being obſtructed. But alſo we think the fault of the blood to preceed in part and perhaps ſometimes wholly for the morbific cauſe; when to wit from its ſulphurous and fixt Saline Particles above meaſure exalted, the choler is more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, or quicklier generated in the maſs of blood, than can be ſeparated or diſcharged forth by the ordinary ways; wherefore this, ſeparating every where from the blood with the Serum,<note place="margin">The cauſe of this diſeaſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the blood.</note> is affixed to the ſolid parts, and impreſſes its tincture upon them. And without doubt it is for this reaſon that ſome poiſons, and chiefly the biting of Vipers, and the dayly uſe of more generous drinks, induces the Jaundies in bodies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſound, for whoſe cure ſometime Phlebotomie, and medicines reducing the blood to a right temper, are wont to profit more than thoſe opening obſtructions. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over it ſeems for this reaſon, that a tertian intermiting Feaver ſo frequently termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates in the Jaundies; for we may not ſuſpect the paſſages of the Liver can be by any means obſtucted, ſince in all fits, ſo great an agitation of the blood and humours, by cold, and heat, and ſuch an evacuation of them happens either by vomit or ſweat: and truly even as feaveriſh fits are cauſed, inasmuch as the ſulphurous part of the blood being too much advanced, in the firſt place perverts the nutritious juice into a morbific matter, and afterwards being inflam'd conſumes and exterminates it; ſo when the fixt ſalt is at laſt exalted together with the ſulphur in the blood, and for that cauſe meer choler is abundantly engendered, the feaveriſh enkindling of the blood ceaſes, by reaſon of the reſtrictive force of the fixt ſalt, and in place thereof the diſtemper of the Jaundies doth ſucceed. But as the blood being too much advanced to a ſulphureo-ſaline diſtemperature cauſes the Jaundies in any, though leaſt prediſpos'd to it; ſo in others very much diſpoſed thereto, having the ways of choler obſtructed &amp; the ſulphur of the blood being too much depreſſed, it produces a freedome from that diſeaſe; for I have known many cachectick and phlegmatick perſons, to have been free from the Jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:40331:163"/> though they have ſuffered under obſtructions and indurations of the Liver, as to moſt of its paſſages.</p>
                        <p>It is not worth our labour to make more ample diſquiſition about the aetiologie of this diſeaſe; as to what reſpects the cure, there will be three primary indications,<note place="margin">The cure of the Jaundies.</note> all which (for what may be the chiefeſt of them, and firſt to be exhibited, for the moſt part is concealed) we ſhall proſecute together; wherefore the intentions of healing ſhall be, 1.

                        <p>THe Liver is ſeldom or never found obnoxious to an Atrophie or extenuation, ſince truly it performs the office of a ſtrainer, and according to ſome, of a mingling bowel; but on the contrary by reaſon of many cauſes and occaſions, it runs the hazard of being encreaſed as to its bulk, and to be ſtufft and ſwell'd with divers things gathered therein, and with concretions. Hence no ſmall account of health conſiſts in this, that the Liver having right conformation may freely convey the blood every where, without keeping back too much Cuſtome or proviſion for it ſelf.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">The Kinds of Remedies aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to the Liver.</note>Truly many faults, and indeed not altogether undeſervedly, are imputed to this Bowel, as alſo unto the Spleen; the chief Kinds of which we ſhall touch upon. The Liver frequently and chiefly is wont to be faulty in one of theſe two, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepting the nutritious juice appointed for other parts, it beſtows it to its own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per uſe; this is plainly diſcerned in Children affected with the Rickets, and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over in many others that lead a ſloathful and idle life. Anciently there was an art with the <hi>Romans</hi> ſo to feed a Gooſe that the Liver prodigiouſly encreaſed might weigh more than the whole body. Secondly, the other fault of the Liver is, that it too eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receives all the excrements and feculencies whatſoever of the depraved Blood, brought into its inward receſs, and by retaining them there, doth not only grow large, but is obſtructed in its paſſages, whence frequently comes the Jaundies, or a Dropſie; it contracts alſo tumours and preternatural Concretions of divers kinds of matter.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Two general in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this bowel.</note>Many and divers diſtempers of the Liver ought to be referred to theſe two heads: of each of which it is not our purpoſe to inſtitute particular pathologies. As to what appertains to the general pharmacie of this bowel, there will be one principal ſcope of curing, that its income be diminiſhed as much as may be, or altogether cut off. Wherefore it will behove us to procure theſe two things, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Liver augment not above meaſure, by taking the nutritious juice too much unto it ſelf; and that it retain not the feculencies of the Blood, whereby it may be affected with obſtructions and preternatural Tumours.</p>
                        <p>It will be much eaſier to prevent than cure either of theſe faults of this bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el. For truly the former may be done, reſpect being had only that the blood be well conſtituted in its Temperament, and enjoying a free Circulation, it may both diſpenſe its nutritious juice to the parts, and eſpecially its outward parts, and driving forth all its excrements to the particular Emiſſaries, it may put them away there. And ſurely, the Medicines vulgarly called Hepaticks, do firſt and more immediately exert their power by purging the blood, rather than by correcting of the Liver: thoſe namely conſiſt of particles of ſuch a kind, which entering into the blood, and not mixing with it, do ſo ſtirre up the maſs thereof, and break it into pieces, that all the Coagulations and Concretions being taken away, all its dregs and impurities may eaſily depart, and being carryed to their proper Emunctories may be caſt out of doors.</p>

                           <note place="margin">Medicines vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly called Splanchnick, firſt and chiefly operate upon the blood.</note>For truly all remedies which are called Splanchnick, firſt work upon the blood, and incite its conſtitutive parts into a kind of efferveſcency, and ſo toſs, divide, and move them rapidly to and fro, that the vaporous effluviums being ſent into the habit of the body, the ſerous excrements into the Kidneys, the cholerick into the Liver, the melancholy into the Spleen, and others to other Emiſſaries for which they are fitted, may be ſhut out, without impediment or adheſion.</p>

                           <note place="margin">What ſuch they are which more eſpecially reſpect the Liver.</note>Wherefore the ſame Remedies which help the Liver, help alſo the Spleen, the Reins, the Lungs, and other the Bowels in their ſeparations; and for the moſt part move ſweating and urine. If any be found to reſpect one part before the reſt by any ſpecifick power, it is therefore becauſe their particles being more ally'd unto the excrements to be ſeparated within that bowel, and from thence aſſociated to them are conveyed thither together with them. For this reaſon Rhubarb, Turmerick, the greater Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landine, with many others adjoyned to the bilious humour, do the more eaſily reach the paſſages of the Gall, and are wont to ſuccour in the Jaundies.

                           </gap>he Remedies thereof, our method leads us to treat of a Dropſie; not becauſe of the Vulgar opinion, that it always ariſes from the fault of the ſame bowel; but becauſe that former diſeaſe having long continued, for the moſt part concludes in this: which happens ſo, not ſo much from the fault of the Liver, as from the whole Blood, for this and not that perform ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guification. Wherefore, when the maſſe hereof hath for a long time been filled with cholerick excrements, and at length degenerating from its temper, accumulates alſo watery humours, then doth a Dropſical Diſpoſition come upon the Jaundies.</p>
                        <p>But whereas three ſorts of Dropſies are vulgarly ſuppoſed, viz. <hi>Aſcites, Tympanites,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">The more remote cauſes of an Aſcites.</note> and <hi>Anaſarca,</hi> we will at preſent handle only the two former, appertaining to the Splanchnick or Pathologie of the nether Belly. And firſt what relates to an Aſcites, this diſeaſe as to its matter and formal reaſon is manifeſtly known by the ſign of even many ſenſes together, <hi>viz.</hi> it is a Tumour of the Abdomen,<note place="margin">Firſt in reſpect of blood.</note> from a wateriſh tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour contained within the cavity thereof. The water making this tumour, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times encreaſes to a huge inundation, and ſcarce credible quantity. I have once ſeen a Tub would hold 15 gallons filled with water taken out of the Abdomen of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man dead of a Dropſie. But whence that humour proceeds, alſo by what manner, and from what cauſes it gathers together in the belly firſt, and afterwards is ſenſibly augmented; and laſtly by what paſſages, and by what vertue and operations of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dragogue Remedies, it may again be taken from thence, and evacuated, ſeems moſt difficult to be unfolded.</p>
                        <p>As to the former, <hi>viz.</hi> the encreaſe of water,<note place="margin">It doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways proceed from the Liver &amp; Spleen.</note> ſome have thought it to deſcend from the Liver, and others from the Spleen diſtempered, into the cavity of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen; and ſo this bowel or that being vitiated, always to be the cauſe of an Aſcites. But that this is otherwiſe, Anatomies of many dead of this diſeaſe, do manifeſtly declare: when after the inundation of the belly, the Liver and Spleen are found often without fault. And truly theſe bowels do not ſeem the Springs of any ſuch illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies, being endowed with no cavityes, wherein waters might be accumulated toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: wherefore the origine of an Aſcites, as of a ſtanding Pool or Lake, is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from a River, or at leaſt a glutt or inundation of ſome Humour.</p>
                        <p>The humours that flow within the paſſages, or Veſſels as Brooks,<note place="margin">The humours by which it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced are,</note> are chiefly theſe three, <hi>viz.</hi> the Blood, the milkie Humour, and the Lympha. The ſhowering or diſtilling of water may come to paſs from the nervous Liquor which ſometimes ſlowly and inſenſibly ſweats out of the fibres and membranes, and from vapours condenſed within the hollowneſs, or ſome Cavity of the Body. Whether by theſe wayes an Aſcites doth rather, and oftener proceed, we will now ſearch.</p>
                        <p>And in the firſt place as to what relates to the blood, it is without doubt,<note place="margin">Firſt the Blood.</note> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum falling from the maſſe thereof, too much diſſolved, as it doth excite Fluxions and Catarrhs of various kindes, ſo it ſometimes ſtirs up the greater illuvies of waters, <hi>viz.</hi> Dropſical: wherefore when an Anaſarca proceeds altogether from this cauſe, and when oftentimes an Aſcites comes upon that diſeaſe not immediately healed, we may well enough inferr that either diſtemper is induced from a watery humour, every where poured out from the little mouths of the Arteries. Moreover, it is not much improbable, that the Serum of the diſſolved Blood is firſt and ſolitarily poured out of ſome end of the Coeliac and Meſenteric Arterie being open into the Cavity of the Abdomen, and ſo brings on an Aſcites without an Anaſarca going before; and ſo eſpecially if perhaps it happen, that ſcirrhous Tumours, Ganglion's, little ſwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or preternatural Concretions of another manner, are firſt raiſed about the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentery, the Spleen, the Liver, the Womb, or any of the other bowels of the nether belly: for, becauſe the Circulation of the blood is hindred in thoſe places, that the blood being carryed through the arteries, may be ſome way brought back, the ſerous part being thruſt out from its company, falls into the cavity. For truly it is moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently manifeſted, that it ſo comes to paſs, by this Experiment mentioned by us in another place, <hi>viz.</hi> If in a living animal, the jugular veins being taken up and bound
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:40331:168"/> with a thred, the reduction of the blood be ſtopt, the whole Region of the head ſwells in a ſhort ſpace, with a water between the skin, and clearly hydropical. And truly I have more frequently obſerved that an Aſcites hath followed upon ſecret tumours gathered and raiſed in ſome place in the lower belly: which certainly happens for the reaſon above recited. When the courſe of blood being obſtructed, the watery part is extravaſated in a ſhort ſpace, that humour is not meerly ſerous, but beſides, the nutritious Liquor, ordained to nouriſh all the ſolid parts, is emptyed into the belly: wherefore, while this Region ſwells up, the members are extenuated, and the Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha taken out from an Aſcites, with heat thickens and grows white, like the white of an Egge.</p>
                        <p>

                              <hi>2, &amp; 3.</hi> The milkie and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery humour.</note>It is alſo very probable, that the milkie Veſſels being burſt aſunder, pour out their humour into the cavity of the abdomen. Truly the moſt renowned <hi>Sylvius</hi> thought this diſeaſe moſt frequently engendred from ſuch a cauſe. And truly as out of the milkie or watery Veſſels, <hi>viz.</hi> one of them or both together, being divided, or opened, we may well ſuſpect the illuvies of water or chyle ſometimes to overflow the bowels of the nether belly; ſo the following obſervation ſeems to confirm the ſame thing. Of late one that had been long ſick of the Jaundies, and in the mean time temperate and abſtemious of drink (to which he was not prompted by thirſt) contracted an Aſcites, increaſed in a ſhort time hugely. After that medicines were adminiſtred in vain, a Paracenteſis is attempted according to the manner of <hi>Sylvius,</hi> with a hollow Needle; out of the orifice, not icterical water, but limpid and thin flowed out abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly; from whence we may inferre, that hydropic humour flowed not out of the maſs of blood, for then it had been coloured, but diſtill'd out of the lymphic or milkie veſſels into the cavity of the abdomen. We have joyn'd together as akin the ways of the milkie and lymphic Veſſels in propagating an Aſcites, becauſe both veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels do convey the chyle, or what is analogous to it, to the common Receptacle; and many branches or leading Pipes of either kind, are diſtributed about the bowels of the nether belly; in the mean time, it is not improbable but that a ſolitary fault of either veſſel may ſometimes produce an Aſcites.</p>
                        <p>As to the other ways of generating an Aſcites, propoſed in the beginning, I am ſcarce induced to think, ſuch an inundation of the belly can eaſily ariſe from the diſtilling of a nervous humour, or by reaſon of vapours there condenſed: although perhaps in a Tym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany where the cavity of the abdomen is enlarged, and tranſpiration hindred, the efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via that were wont to exhale, being forced inwards, are changed into Lympha or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, wherefore for the moſt part an Aſcites is ever conjoyn'd with that diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">An Aſcites often the product of the Jaundies.</note>The immediate or conjunct cauſes of an Aſcites being deſign'd after this manner, which indeed ſeem to be, either a watery humour poured out of the Veſſels bringing Blood, or Lympha or Chyle poured out of the proper paſſages of them both; now we muſt in the next place inquire about the more remote cauſes of this diſeaſe, <hi>viz.</hi> for what occaſions, and after what manner, the veſſels affected of either ſort depoſite their burdens into the cavity of the belly.</p>

                           <note place="margin">The kinds of a Dropſie.</note>Firſt therefore, that the watery part of the blood ſweats out into the <hi>Aqualiculum</hi> or belly, either the very Blood, or Veſſels containing it, or both together, are in fault. The Blood is in fault, when being depraved in its Craſis it doth not rightly contain within its conſiſtence the conſtitutive parts, but being apt to be diſſolved, it every where rejects its ſeroſities from the mixture; which either it drives out by Urine or Sweat, or permitting them to reſide within, pours them out into the pores of the fleſh,<note place="margin">The Deſcription of an Aſcites.</note> or the cavity of the bowels. The veſſels bringing blood grow faulty for a ſecond reaſon, for that their extremities or little mouths either are too much looſe, or altogether ſhut up. In the former ſtate the clew of Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of blood is not entirely and firmly continued; but the thinner and more crude part of the blood being apt to depart, is ſuffered to flow out near to the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaces or inoſculations of the Arteries and Veins; likewiſe on the other ſide, when the courſe of blood is hindred, by reaſon of a tumour or obſtruction of ſome veſſels, their little mouths being throughly cloſed; to this being ſo ſtraitned that a paſſage may be made open by ſome means, that which is thin and watery is extravaſated, and ſent away into the neighbouring places, as we have ſhewed above.</p>

But an Aſcites beginning alone, doth often ariſe, by reaſon of the milkie or lymphatic veſſels being depraved; wherefore ſeeing we ſuppoſe the cauſe of this kind of diſeaſe to be oftentimes conjunct, we muſt enquire, by what means, and for what occaſions, theſe veſſels are wont to be ſo opened or burſt aſunder, that they pour out their liquor into the cavity of the belly.</p>
                        <pb n="107" facs="tcp:40331:168"/>
                        <p>Firſt therefore as to what belongs to the Lymphaducts, theſe veſſels may be in fault after a diverſe manner, but chiefly, either that being obſtructed or compreſſed near their origine, they do not receive the humour, or being burſt about the middle or extream parts, do pour it out into the belly. There are many cauſes and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of effecting of either of theſe, for it may be a viſcous matter obſtructs their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings, or glandulous, ſcirrhous, and other preternatural Tumours compreſs them, as alſo a vaſt inundation of Lympha flowing out, moreover vehement motions of the Body, or paſſions of the mind, may burſt them aſunder.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The milkie Veſſels, no leſs than Lymphatick, are in danger to be broke,<note place="margin">

There are many cauſes and occaſions, for which the thicker and obſtructing humours are driven forwards into the milkie Veſſels; for beſides an irregular Diet, and for the moſt part from meats hard to be digeſted, this evil is frequently cauſed by too much drink, or immoderate exerciſe immediately after Food, alſo from cold drink while the Bowels are very hot; for ſo the paſſages of the Veſſels before gaping are ſuddenly ſhut, and afterwards more narrowly cloſed, wherefore the chyle ſticking within their ſtraitned chanels, doth throughly fill and obſtruct them in a ſhort ſpace.</p>
                        <p>As to what belongs to the differences of this Diſeaſe, beſides them already cited,<note place="margin">The differences of this diſeaſe.</note> 
                           <hi>viz.</hi> that it comes after an Anaſarca, or comes ſolitary; that this alſo is manifold and after a diverſe manner, according as the Veſſels bringing blood, or water, or milk, are found in the fault; Moreover we obſerve, that the Dropſie called Aſcites ſometimes proceeds from a meer watery humour filling and diſtending the parts of the nether belly; but ſometimes there happens to this deluge an extenſion of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, or inflations made by the irregularities of the inmate ſpirits, and ſo they do encreaſe the ſwelling of the Abdomen; and in this caſe a certain Tympanites comes upon an Aſcites, even as more frequently on the contrary, this is the offspring of that.</p>

                        <p>The Prognoſtick of this Diſeaſe, is always ſuſpected and accounted of an ill omen:<note place="margin">The Prognoſtick.</note> for none of the vulgar but will pronounce the obſtinate tumour of the belly to be very dangerous and difficult to cure: If any ſeem to be affected with a Dropſie, or a Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, with them preſently the next queſtion is, Who ſhall be his heir.</p>
                        <p>An Aſcites beginning after an Anaſarca (which proceeds commonly from the whole maſs of blood being pour'd forth into ſeroſities, and ſweating them out of the little mouths of the Arteries into the cavity of the Abdomen) is accounted of eaſier cure, or at leaſt of more promiſing hope, than that ſolitary diſeaſe coming from tumours about the bowels, or from the Lymphatick or lacteal Veſſels being burſt aſunder; for as well the conjunct as procatarctick cauſe of the former Diſeaſe, oftentimes is uſed to be removed wholly, or in part; but in the other caſe, both for the moſt part exiſt incurable. A reddiſh Urine, lixivial, and little, in an Aſcites is of ill ſignification, for 'tis a ſign that the maſs of blood, being repleated with a ſcorbutick Salt and Sulphur boyled together, is too much bound up in its ſubſtance; inſomuch that it doth not well ſeparate the feculencies, nor diſcharge them by fit and convenient Sinks, which notwithſtanding it doth evilly diſpoſe by conſtraint into the Cavity of the Belly, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as it is hindred in its Circulation in the very ſame place. For in an Aſcites the blood is not always diſſolved as in an Anaſarca, but ſometimes appears too much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted in its temper, yet ſo, that the ſalt Serum being denyed to the pores of the skin,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:40331:169"/> and to the Urinary paſſages, by reaſon of the Obſtructions of the bowels is forced to break out within the abdomen.</p>
                        <p>If in an Aſcites, by a Purge taken, the waters are evacuated with eaſe plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully by ſtool, and from thence the ſwelling of the belly is ſomewhat diminiſhed, we are not to deſpair of the Cure; but if Purgers bring out little or nothing of the Serum, or Lympha, and thence by reaſon of the Nervous fibres being irritated, and driven into extenſions or inflations of the bowels and membranes (as it uſes frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be) the belly ſwells the more, and grows like a Drum, we may expect only a fatal event of the Diſeaſe.</p>

                              <hi>2.</hi> Diuretick Hydragogoues.</note> but Cathar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks do not always cure an Aſcites, yea often-times exaſperate it, and (if they be long continued) render it incurable; hence it is neceſſary to have recourſe to other Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes for the Cure of this diſeaſe. Wherefore, let us next enquire whether Diureticks do here profit or not?</p>
                        <p>And truly any one may eaſily think that Remedies moving Urine conduce very much for draining waters out of every place or cavity of the body. In truth it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt by frequent experience, theſe do often cure an Anaſarca before any other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy; let us ſee what they may effect for the emptying the Cavity of the Abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
                        <p>As to this it firſt appears,<note place="margin">What Profit they bring in an Aſcites.</note> that there is no paſſage immediately open from an Aſcitick pool to the Reins, although contiguous; but that whatſoever waters are transferred from hence thither, muſt of neceſſity firſt be drunk up into the maſs of blood, and from thence be poured out of its boſom into the ſink of Urine; and truly it is but a little which the gaping little mouths of the veins about the ſuperficies of the bowels can receive (if perhaps they are open at all) and Diureticks can but effect this one thing, that by pouring forth the blood, and forcing its ſeroſities more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully to the Kidnies, they cauſe the waters fluctuating in the belly to be allured to it being ſo emptyed; in the mean time there is no leſs danger, leſt Diureticks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unſeaſonably adminiſtred, while they diſſolve the blood too much, they conſtrain the ſerum to depart into the ſeat of the Aſcites, more than into the Reins, and ſo rather augment than remove the inundation of the belly. For that it ſometimes ſo happens, I have often found by experience; wherefore when Diureticks are preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to cure an Aſcites, we muſt chiefly provide againſt ſuch a contrary effect. For this reaſon indeed Aſtringents and Corroboratives are always mixt in Remedies for the Dropſie (founded on experience, and the Authority and Practice of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients) not that ſuch (as is commonly ſaid) do confirm the Tone of the Liver, but conſerve the temperature, and mixture of the blood, leſt it be wholly diſſolved by too great a fuſion. Wherefore in an Aſcites which chiefly or in part happens by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the frame of the bowels and veſſels, and chiefly the Coats, Glandules, and their little ſtrings, and their interſpaces being ſtuffed by a ſerous humour, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore very much ſwell'd up, as Catharticks ſo alſo Diureticks profit, and are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently taken with ſucceſs; foraſmuch as by the uſe of theſe the maſſe of blood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing emptyed (the ſerum being more plentifully derived to the kidneys) doth eaſily receive unto it ſelf thoſe waters every where ſtagnating about their little mouths, and conveys it towards the urinary ſink: but on the contrary, in a meer Aſcites where the heap of waters do overflow the Cavity of the Belly, the Textures of the bowels being free from the ſerous ſtuffing; Diureticks are given in vain, or incommodiouſly; inaſmuCh as they expreſs nothing from this Lake of the belly, and moſt frequently by diſſolving the blood more impetuouſly drive together the waters apt to be inſtill'd there.</p>
                        <p>Not all Diureticks of every kinde are equally convenient in an Aſcites,<note place="margin">With what choice and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference they ought to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred.</note> neither ought they indifferently to be adminiſtred, for we muſt obſerve, the affected in this diſeaſe for the moſt part make a little, reddiſh Urine, and as it were lixivial; which truly is an indication that the temperature of the blood is too much bound in them, by reaſon of the fixt and ſulphureous Salt exalted and combined together: and therefore that the Serum is not duely ſeparated within the reins; which notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is ſhook off about the windings of the obſtructed bowels, and ſo is depoſited in the Cavity of the Belly. Wherefore in this Caſe it will be convenient to drink only thoſe things to excite Urine, which ſo reſtore and amend the Conſtitution of the blood, that the enormities of the fixed Salt and Sulphur being taken away, the ſerous part might be ſeparated within the reins, and more plentifully diſcharged; for which purpoſe, not acid or lixivial things, but thoſe endowed with a volatile Salt are appointed. For I have often obſerved in Patients of that kind, when the Spirit
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:40331:171"/> of Salt, and other acid drops of Minerals; and when the diſſolutions and Deliqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums of Salt of Tartar, Broom and other things, have done more hurt than good, that the Juice of Plantane, Brooklime, and other Herbs abounding with a volatile Salt, have much helped, as alſo the expreſſions of Millepedes: for the ſame reaſon Salt of Nitre throughly purified or Cryſtal Mineral doth often profit. Forms of Medicines more accommodate for this uſe are extant in our former Treatiſe, where, <hi>viz.</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of Diureticks are deſcribed, in which both volatile and nitrous Salts are the Baſis. Moreover, hither ought to be referred the notable experiment, by which <hi>Joannes Anglus</hi> affirms himſelf often to have cured the Aſcites from a hot cauſe,<note place="margin">

                           <hi>Take of the juice of Plantane and Liverwort, and fill an Earthen pot to the top, which being ſtopt cloſe, put in a hot Oven after the Bread is drawn, and make a little fire on the ſides of the pot to continue the heat of the Oven; after it is ſo boyl'd ſtrain it, and being ſweetened with Sugar, drink of it Morning and Evening, and it cures.</hi> In imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this I have often with ſucceſs preſcribed as followeth.</p>

Moreover from ſweating unadvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly inſtituted, the blood being forced into a fuſion and precipitation of the Serum, throws it off the more into the neſt of the Aſcites. Wherefore when ſome preſcribe fomentations, and liniments, and bathing, to be applyed to the ſwelling Paunch of the Belly, for the moſt part it turns to the worſe in ſuch Patients; for beſides a little Feaver, a Vertigoe, fainting of the ſpirits, and other ill ſymptomes of the brain and heart, being moſt frequently ſo raiſed, even the belly alſo doth from thence ſwell the more: foraſmuch as the Blood being agitated and poured out, depoſits in that place more largely the Serum; and for that cauſe the mouths of the Veſſels are more looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and opened, ſo that they may more readily let fall water prone to depart from the maſs of blood.

                        <p>The great and moſt preſent remedy of an Aſcites, is, that the waters may be drawn out by a Paracenteſis being made; which adminiſtration however doth not oftner cure the diſeaſe, than kill the Patient; wherefore there is need of exact caution

After having uſed this kind of dyet for a fortnight, ſhe contracted a vaſt Aſcites in a ſhort time, the beginning whereof ſhe was not in the leaſt ſenſible of; for her Abdomen being great with water fluctuating within, did much ſwell up, and its bulk when ſhe turned from one ſide to the other, fell without the Ileon and borders of the reſt of the body: when in the mean while the fleſh of all her Members was very much conſumed, that ſhe ſeemed no leſs in a conſumption than a Dropſie.</p>
                        <p>The Child being weaned, and a better courſe of Diet being appointed, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took her ſelf to Medicines, and took in the firſt place the more mild Hydragogues, as well purgative as diuretical, but without any advantage; alſo ſhe was worſe after every purge; but being committed to our care, and almoſt deſperate, I handled her after the enſuing method.</p>

But the former infeſting the region of the Abdomen, and raiſing it up into a bulk, now comes under conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration next after an Aſcites, (to which it is ſomething a-kin): where firſt of all it is obvious, that this Diſeaſe as it is moſt difficult to cure, ſo alſo to be known; for although its outward form, <hi>viz.</hi> a ſomewhat hard ſwelling of the belly, very ſtiffe and yielding a ſound like a Drum, upon touching it, is evidently perceived by many ſenſes together; notwithſtanding what may be the morbiſick matter inducing that Tumour, or after what manner it is generated in the belly, or from what place it comes thither, is altogether unknown: therefore thoſe who have a Tympanie, as though they were big with winde, are ignorant both of the manner and time of its conception.<note place="margin">Wherefore its cauſe is occult.</note> Truly I therefore judge the nature and cauſes of this diſeaſe to lye concealed, becauſe whereas its firſt beginnings are not obſerved, it ſuddenly aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments prodigiouſly; ſo that they who are affected, do ſcarce ſooner perceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be ſick, than that they are become almoſt incurable. Moreover, a Tympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, its ſtation being accompliſhed, degenerating into an Aſcites, or rather procuring it to its ſelf, ſeems to loſe its own nature; and truly after death Anatomical inſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſcarce diſcovers any thing more in bodies dying with a Tympany, than with an Aſcites.<note place="margin">Commonly aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to Winde.</note> But that many Phyſical Authors do readily declare this Diſtemper to be raiſed by wind encloſed within the cavity of the abdomen, doth not at all ſatisfie a mind deſirous of the truth; becauſe it ſeems altogether improbable that winds ſhould be produced ſo ſuddenly, and in ſo great plenty in that place; or admit they were, that ſo hard, unmovable and conſtant a tumour ſhould be raiſed.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Authors do not agree about the ſeat of the Windes.</note>Moreover they do not eaſily agree concerning the ſeat of the diſeaſe, where the wind is ſuppoſed to be included; for ſome affirm that this place is determinate in the concave of the Peritonaeum, and by the convex ſuperficies of the Inteſtines, and other bowels of the lower part of the belly; but after what manner ſuch a heap of winds can be therein collected, in my opinion it cannot be manifeſted by any reaſon, exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or parallel inſtance. Beſides, if the caſe were ſuch, it might be more eaſily cured by pricking, than an Aſcites by a Paracenteſis; which yet I never heard accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.<note place="margin">Not without the guts in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen.</note> 
                           <hi>Helmont</hi> reports a ſtinking wind was vented by a Paracenteſis, in one eſteemed Hydropick; that ſuddenly his abdomen ſunk, and the man dyed immediately. But <hi>Platerius</hi> and <hi>Smetius,</hi> no leſs worthy of credit, do affirm, <hi>They diſcovered in ſome who were thought to have the Tympanie, and diſſected after death, that no wind broke forth out of the hollow of the belly, neither that it fell, but that eſpecially the ſmaller guts being diſtended, and ſtrutting with winde, burſt out ſo, that they could not be put up again into the ſame belly.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Nor within their paſſages.</note>But truly neither is this obſervation an argument to me, that the cauſe of the diſeaſe (of which we treat) remains within the Cavities of the guts, and that the winds ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulated in that place, do often or moſt of all raiſe a Tympanitick ſwelling of the belly. For beſides that, a diſeaſe taking riſe from ſuch an occaſion, would not be ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable, and frequently incurable; moreover, I am induced to think, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines are not ſo greatly dilated by winds ſhut up in them, but that they often of their own accord ſwelling out, give occaſion to thoſe winds conſequently and ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darily to be produced, by which the ſpaces enlarged might be filled, as we ſhall by and by more clearly demonſtrate.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Not between the coats of the bowels.</note>But what is aſſerted by others, that the windes which are the cauſe of a Tympany, are engendered among the Coats of the Meſentery, and Guts, ſeems yet much more improbable; becauſe when there is no cavity in that place preexiſtent, after what manner can the winds ſo tear thoſe parts and ſeparate them from one and another, ſo that from ſuch formed Denns, the whole region of the Belly ſhould grow into ſo vaſt a bulk by accumulated windes there laid up? Certainly ſo many and ſo great divulſions could not be made without continual torment and moſt ſharp pains.</p>
                        <pb n="115" facs="tcp:40331:172"/>
                        <p>Wherefore, omitting theſe opinions already ſpoken of about a Tympanie,<note place="margin">By what and how many cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the Belly ſwells.</note> let us proceed another way to the more aſſured ſearching out its Pathologie; <hi>viz.</hi> by tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly weighing by what means, and by what evident cauſes, the Abdomen is wont to ſwell up. Wherefore, we advertiſe there are four kinds of things contained, from which proceeds a tumour in the nether Belly of the living, (why the Abdomen ſwells in dead perſons, the reaſons follow hereafter) which kinds are, ſolid, humid, wind and Spirits.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, It is obvious enough, that the inward tumours of the bowels, <hi>viz.</hi> ſcirrhous,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>1.</hi> From tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of the Bowels in that place.</note> ſtrumous, cancrous and glandulous, and ſome perhaps of another kinde, when they riſe to any notable bulk, do ſwell the whole belly; yet in the mean time as long as they are ſimple, and new, they may be perceived and circumſcribed by the touch; yet afterwards growing inveterate, they cauſe other evils to the neighbouring parts, yea over the whole Region of the Abdomen. Truly theſe as they are ſometimes the procuring cauſe of an Aſcites, ſo of a Tympany from the beginning, to which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards for a complement of either diſeaſe, another conjunct cauſe gains acceſs, <hi>viz.</hi> an illuvies of waters, or an irregularity of the Spirits.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, a watery humour gathered within the Cavity of the abdomen,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>2.</hi> From wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters gathered as in an Aſcites.</note> or being impacted in the membranous or glandulous parts thereof, frequently produces an Aſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, the reaſons whereof, and the manner of its coming to paſs, are at large ſet down before.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, Winds within the bowels of Concoction being raiſed from crudities,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>3.</hi> From winds.</note> ill concoction, or fermentation of heterogeneous humours, do frequently puff up the Cavity of the guts, and for the moſt part produce a ſhort and tranſitory tumour of the belly. For the fermentation of the Juices ceaſing, and eruption of wind being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, immediately ſucceeds an aſſwaging of the Belly. To this cauſe, both the Colick and Tympanie, not only by the vulgar but by Phyſicians of great note are imputed; but in our judgement, when it is ſolitary it produces neither of theſe diſtempers.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, There yet remains another ſudden, and vaſt ſwelling of the belly,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>4.</hi> From the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flation of the Fibres, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed.</note> which the animal Spirits, (not for nothing ſtyl'd by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> violent) ſeem to procure. For when theſe in heaps, and inordinately, ruſh into the nervous fibres belonging to the bowels of the lower belly, preſently the parts that theſe weave together are cauſed to be puffed up, and extended every where round about. For truly, from this cauſe (as we have often ſhewed in another place) a ſwelling, and as it were a tympanitical puffing up of the whole abdomen, as well in the Colick as in Hyſterical fits vulgarly ſo called, doth often happen. And truly theſe diſtempers are ſo allyed to a Tympany, that they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently end in it; for I have oft obſerved, that thoſe who have been obnoxious to the Colick and hyſterical paſſion long and grievouſly, unleſs they receive cure, do become Tympanitical. And then the greateſt of the difference will be, that the ſwelling of the belly, which before was a wandring Symptom, and ſoon paſſing over, at length grows to be a fixt and permanent diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore, it ſeems material in this Caſe, to accommodate the Aetiologie of thoſe paſſions delivered by us in another place, to unfold the Nature and Cauſes of this preſent maladie.</p>
                        <p>Which truly will not be of any great buſineſs or difficulty.<note place="margin">An Affection of what ſort a Tympany is.</note> For ſuppoſing (what we have in another place more largely ſet down) the extenſions and inflations of the membranes and hollow bowels, take their origine from the impetuous invaſions of the Spirits into the nervous fibres (of which they are interwoven) it will be obvious enough to conceive even a Tympanie to be produced from ſuch a cauſe, but being more fixt, and longer, or unceſſantly in the act; into the reaſon of which difference, we will by and by inquire.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time I am induced to believe a Tympanie not to be ſtirred up from winds ſhut up within, or without the Cavity of the guts,<note place="margin">Its cauſe and formal reaſon explicated.</note> (for ſuch an accumulation of winds in thoſe places, is an effect, but not a cauſe of this diſeaſe) but that it does ariſe, inaſmuch as the animal Spirits, in the bottom of the belly, belonging to the membranous bowels, being forced into diſorder by ſomething incongruous, do tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuouſly ruſh every where into the nervous fibres, and puffe them up, neither do they immediately recede back from them: from hence the Peritonaeum ſwells, and the guts being blown up and enlarged, they are as it were inflated, the Meſentery, and other membranous bowels, being turgid with an impetuous Spirit, are as it were raiſed up into a bulk; moreover, while theſe come thus to paſs, that the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuities cauſed from the ſwelling of hollow bowels might be filled, a portion preſently
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:40331:173"/> of every humour within contained, being rarified into vapours, forthwith turns into wind, wandring about thoſe empty ſpaces.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">And proved by arguments and inſtances.</note>Truly, we have clearly enough ſhewn, by reaſons and inſtances in our Pathologie of Convulſions, that the animal ſpirits puff up the membranous parts by their irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity, and ſo produce as it were this windie Diſtemper. Moreover the ſame is demonſtrated by Anatomical obſervation made in diſſecting a living Creature; <hi>viz.</hi> inaſmuch as the Trunk of the eighth pair of Nerves, deſcending on each ſide by the Neck, if it be taken out and bound with a thred, forthwith all the ſtomach ſwells up, as if it were puffed with winde;<note place="margin">An univerſal Tympanie.</note> which certainly can proceed from no other cauſe than that the animal Spirits of the fibres of that bowel, and others flowing through the nervous paſſages, (inaſmuch as they being cut off from their origine, are driven into confuſion) do tumultuouſly enter thoſe parts, and puff them up. Beſides theſe, for the further illuſtrating of this Hypotheſis, I will relate a Hiſtory cited by the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned <hi>Smetius,</hi> of an univerſal Tympany (as he calls it) in a certain young man of <hi>Liege: Who when he had received, in a conflict, under his right arm-pit, a wound, made by a prick, penetrating into the Cavity of his breaſt, next day and night being paſt, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the morning after ſwell'd throughout his whole body, not only in his breaſt, but alſo in his back, belly, loins, and in the cods, beſides both in his arms, ſhoulders, neck and face, that he could not open his eye-lids, alſo on the crown of his head, the skin being every where ſwolne and tumefied, the tumour was every where extended with great pain.</hi> The Author calls this wonderful affection, an Univerſal Tympanie. The moſt renowned <hi>Sennertus</hi> relates a Caſe like this from his own knowledge: Moreover, I remember I have heard or read of the like from a wound of the breaſt being received near the arm-pit.</p>

But aſſuredly the cauſe of that wonderful affection is this;<note place="margin">The true cauſe aſſigned.</note> (whence alſo the formal reaſon of a Tympanie is illuſtrated) In the Breaſt near the Arm-pits, are many and eminent fold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Nerves, (as we have deſcribed in our Treatiſe of Nerves,) by which the nerves of the whole body communicate among themſelves: <hi>viz.</hi> the Trunk of the eighth pair unites with the intercoſtal Nerve, and both with the nerves of the <hi>Spina Dorſi,</hi> by branches and ſprigs ſent here and there. Wherefore, this nervous folding, perchance being pierced by the point of the Sword, firſt of all the ſpirits reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in that place being provok'd, run into diſorders, afterwards a conſent being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately made thorow ſo many notable Nerves, and tranſmitted to and fro every where, other Spirits, and then again others, are ſenſible of the like irregularities, and puffing up the membranous and nervous Fibres (which every where they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter tumultuouſly) they induce as it were a tympanitical affection through the whole body. By reaſon of the like fury or virulent madneſs impoſed upon the Spirits, in any place, and from thence immediately diffuſed far and wide, certain Poyſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drunk, the ſtrokes of weapons, or of wild Beaſts, or a venemous bite, do fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently induce a ſwelling together of many parts, or of the whole body; which welling diſtemper of the Spirits, is ſtyl'd by <hi>Helmont</hi> to be <hi>Indignatio Archaeas.</hi> There are many other Caſes and Inſtances, by which it is moſt clearly evinced, that the Animal Spirits being provok'd, and driven into angry inclinations, inaſmuch as they do more impetuouſly enter into the nervous Fibres, are wont firſt to ſwell the membranous parts, and to excite many paſſions out of thoſe, which are vulgarly but falſely aſcribed to windes: ſo that in truth no other cauſe of a Tympanie can be aſſigned more like truth.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Why the belly ſwells in the dead.</note>If it be objected, that the Paunches of the defunct after ſome time are raiſed by winde into a bulk, and ſwell like as in a Tympany: I pronounce this to proceed from the putrefaction of humours, and the extream diſſolution of the mixture, wherein
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:40331:173"/> all the active particles depart, being freed one from the other, and flying about ſeek vent in every place, and diſtend greatly all obſtacles, and chiefly the ſides of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities, (which doth not at all happen in living bodies;) wherefore, as all Carkaſes do not putrifie alike, ſo their bellies ſwell ſooner or later, more or leſs: But while life endures, no rottenneſs or diſſolution of particles is made in an animated body, that can bring about a ſplanchnick fermentation or ſwelling. In the mean while we deny not, that winds are generated within the offices of concoction, ſanguification, and ſeparation, yea within all the particular cells and receſſes of our whole body; notwithſtanding from them all, unto the winds whereſoever engendred (whileſt the Spirits have their due influence, and actuate the nervous as well as moving fibres, that the ſides of the bowels be not kept diſtended and rigid) an eaſie vent does every where lye open. And the truth is, in a Tympany, we allow the wind to fill up the empty ſpaces, but the ſpirits, inaſmuch as they extend the bowels by their irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, do firſt cauſe thoſe vacuities, (wherein the winds ſecondarily and conſequently are engendred) and they (inaſmuch as the ſame bowels are ſtill kept ſtrutted and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtended) do hinder thoſe winds from being removed.</p>
                        <p>And now I judge it is plain enough by what we have ſaid,<note place="margin">The Animal Spirits and not winde the cauſe of the Tympanie.</note> that the animal ſpirits ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the wind do raiſe ſwellings of the belly in that ſort; at leaſt ſuch ſhort and tranſitory ones, as happen in Hyſterical and Colick fits. Notwithſtanding there yet remains a great difficulty, after what manner the Tympanitical ſwelling of the Abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, which is fixt and permanent, yea for the moſt part immovable, can proceed from any ſuch cauſe; eſpecially, becauſe the Animal Spirits being of their own nature active and very apt to motion, do for the moſt part ſo affect removal, that unleſs they be wearyed or become defunct, they ſcarce ever lie ſtill.</p>
                        <p>That I may looſen this knot by reaſoning, it becomes us to conſider the Nervous Juice together with the ſubſtance of the Animal Spirits, which is every where a vehicle to them, and alſo a bridle: for the Spirits enjoying the moſt ſubtile ſtream thereof, do freely expatiate, and leſt being diſſipated from one another, they might fly away, they are contained in an entire ſeries. When therefore that Juice is faulty as to its temper or motion, immediately the animal ſpirits become diverſly delinquent, or are perverted in the exerciſes of their functions, as we have at large expounded in our Treatiſe of Paſſions. And leſt by repeating them now I ſhould make long Preambles, I will contract into a few words what belongs to the preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore in the firſt place, it is to be obſerved,<note place="margin">This happens by the fault of the Nervous juice.</note> that the contents of the nether belly (excepting only the Liver, Spleen, and Kidneys) are furniſhed with many mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous bowels, (which the nervous fibres for the moſt part weave together) whence it follows that the nervous Juice (whoſe journey is longer, and the paſſages ſtraiter in theſe parts) doth find here many remora's: which alſo may be proved from the effect, foraſmuch as the convulſive invaſions, every where ſtirr'd up in the Hypochondriack, Colick, Nephritical and Hyſterical Paſſions, do ſo grievouſly infeſt the Abdomen. When therefore that Juice watering the nervous fibres of theſe parts, ſhall be either viſcid or tenacious of it ſelf, or fill them with very many feculencies, for that cauſe it will come to paſs, that all the animal ſpirits will not eaſily return from thence as oft as they are hurl'd into theſe fibres, in ſome part obſtructed: and when in this manner there is a full incurſion, and a ſmall return of them, at length it will happen that great abundance of the ſpirits remain in theſe fibres every day more and more impacted, and hold them always diſtended and very much pufft up; and at length by reaſon of the ways of their ingreſs and regreſs in thoſe fibres being obſtructed, they become immovable in that place, and keep the affected parts always extended and ſtiffe:<note place="margin">By the obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereof the Spirits within the fibres are detained and made immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable.</note> in the mean time becauſe theſe Spirits there impacted within the nervous paſſages, and cramm'd thick, have commerce with others that flow to them in their dens, therefore the affected part although it be ſtiffe and almoſt immovable, yet how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever enjoys ſenſe. This Pathologie although it may ſeem to ſome a Paradox, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth, I doubt not but it will deſerve aſſent from many, if it be throughly weighed, that thoſe who have been a long time obnoxious to Hypochondriack, Colick, and other convulſive diſtempers of the nether Belly, do at length become ſick of a Tym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
                        <p>The formal reaſon and conjunct cauſe of a Tympanie being delineated after this manner, before we proceed to trace out diligently the more remote cauſes thereof, it may be lawfull for us from what we have ſaid to deliver a definition, or at leaſt a
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:40331:174"/> certain deſcription of this diſeaſe, viz. <hi>That it is a fixt and conſtant Tumour of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen,</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>As to what appertains to the procuring and evident cauſes of this diſeaſe, it very ſeldom happeneth that they are altogether obſerved,<note place="margin">Its procuring cauſes.</note> but that inſinuating it ſelf by ſilent beginnings, it frequently is finiſhed, or becomes deplorable before it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; inſomuch that againſt this diſeaſe ſcarce any antidote can be appointed; for while the ordinary functions are not much prejudiced, the ſwelling of the belly is preſumed only to have its origine from winde, and while it is expected to vaniſh ſpontaneouſly, it often grows into a Tympanie. Wherefore that we may have time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly notice of its beginning, we may take notice, that ſome previous affects diſpoſe to it;<note place="margin">Other previous convulſive af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</note> of this ſort is firſt an Hypochondriack, Colical and Hyſterical diſpoſition, yea and ſometimes an Aſthmatical; whoſe fits when they are uſed to be frequently raiſed, if at length a tumour of the Abdomen follow it, though it be ſmall in the beginning, a Tympany forthwith may be feared. Of the former of theſe affects caſes every where are to be met with, and ſtand fair to common obſervation: of the later <hi>Scheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius</hi> reports,<note place="margin">The caſe of an Aſthma ending in a Tympanie.</note> 
                           <hi>That a man of Sixty years of age was infeſted with this ſymptome ſome months before his Belly was ſwell'd into any manifeſt tumour, that as often as he ſate at meat, beginning to eat, alſo when compoſing himſelf for ſleep, he began to ſleep ſoundly, he was ſurprized with ſuch a difficulty of breathing, that the frequency of it threatned the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of choaking; at which time alſo he perceived a certain palpitation about the Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria, as if ſome living Animal were underneath the midriff; this diſtemper afterwards ended in a Tumour of the Abdomen, by which he dyed.</hi> In this and other caſes now cited the ſame reaſon holds, <hi>viz.</hi> that the animal ſpirits being uſed to make irregular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions into the nervous Fibres of the lower belly, at length do not only more often and abundantly enter into them, but being impacted and hindered they abide in them,<note place="margin">The evident cauſes of this diſeaſe.</note> and ſo at length induce tympanitic inflations of the bowels. Truly this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bific beginning happens ſooner or later, if thereupon do come the evident cauſes, which diſturb the Spirits in the bottom of the belly, and compel them to frequent diſorders, and alſo do either ſtop the motion or pervert the temperature of the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Juice flowing within thoſe Fibres; in which rank are accounted irregularities in the ſix Non-naturals, immoderate Paſſions, and chiefly of grief, and uſual evacuations ſuppreſs'd, drinking of cold water after ſome great heat, or any ſudden cold induced on the belly, either from air or water.</p>

                           <note place="margin">The Prognoſticks thereof.</note>As to the Prognoſticks, this diſeaſe is always accounted of ſo bad an omen that commonly the name is abhorr'd, inſomuch that frequently when there is no ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of ill from the tumour of the belly, if perhaps that ſwelling be call'd by the Phyſitian, a Tympanie, forthwith it is concluded deſperate. Notwithſtanding this Diſeaſe rarely kills of it ſelf, but being protracted a long ſpace of time, that it may at length more certainly kill, it gains to it ſelf an Aſcites, as a Harbinger of Death. That we may ſearch into the reaſon thereof, it will be obvious enough to conceive, while all the bowels are diſtended in the lower belly, and are held as it were ſtiffe, the paſſages of the blood, and nervous and lymphatic humours, being too much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, or compreſſed are much ſtraitened, and for that cauſe cannot freely and readily tranſmit its Juice; from whence it follows that every humour being ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the paſſage, that at length it may paſs by ſome means, it ſhakes off a certain ſeroſity from its maſſe wherever way is given; and thoſe droppings of the humours falling into the hollow of the Abdomen, excite an Aſcitick Dropſie.</p>

                           <note place="margin">The Cure.</note>What relates to the Curatory part of this Diſeaſe, the whole ſcope of healing is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly bent againſt wind, <hi>viz.</hi> Indications inculcated by practical Authors ſuggeſt the matter to be evacuated, from whence the winds are raiſed, and to remove the cauſe that lifts them up, and the winds to be diſcuſs'd and diſſipated, which do already diſtend the belly.</p>
                        <p>For theſe ends Purgers appointed againſt the humour chiefly ſuſpected are wont to be preſcribed with great confidence, although with ſmall or ill ſucceſs; that is to ſay, Phlegmagogues ſo called, another while thoſe that purge Melancholy, another while thoſe that purge Choler, whereto alſo are joyn'd purgers of water (as weapons intended againſt every enemy.) For this diſeaſe (as is manifeſt by our obſervation) is
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:40331:174"/> wont for the moſt part to be exaſperated with ſtrong Purgers, and ſeldom alleviated; the reaſon whereof is evident enough, becauſe the nervous fibres being provok't by a ſharp Medicine, the animal Spirits renew their irregular excurſions,<note place="margin">Remedies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned againſt Wind profit not.</note> and do every where more and more ſtretch them out, rather than give any remiſſion to them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, although frequent and abundant watery and flatulent ſtools are procured, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Belly ſwells the more. Moreover, to diſpell, diſcuſſe, and bridle the winde, there is a more than Aeolian power preſcribed; Medicines commonly call'd <hi>Carminatives,</hi> almoſt of every kind or form are ſedulouſly adminiſtred, within and without, above and beneath, and upon the part affected; notwithſtanding this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe for the moſt part is untamed by all theſe; whence we may ſuſpect, that the true cauſe of the diſeaſe lyes as yet conceal'd, becauſe Medicines profit not that are adminiſtred, indicated or ſuggeſted according to the ordinary Aetiologie or reaſon of it.</p>

                        <p>Wherefore in a Tympany, as in moſt other affections,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>3.</hi> Curatory In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications.</note> there will be three chief indications: Whereof the firſt, and chiefly inſiſted on, is the Curatory, that by recall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the animal Spirits from their convulſive affection, and reducing them into order, endeavours the removal of the ſwelling of the Belly. The ſecond Preſervatory, which reſtrains thoſe or other Spirits from their irregular excurſions into the lower Belly, and together corrects the faults of the nervous liquor, watering it, both as to its tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or motion. The third Vital, by removing the Symptoms urging, doth ſuccour and ſuſtain all the functions oppreſſed or weakened, as much as poſſible may be.</p>
                        <p n="1">I. The firſt Indication is of greateſt moment,<note place="margin">The firſt Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation hardeſt.</note> on which the hinge of the whole Cure turns, but it is moſt difficultly performed, for it doth not eaſily appear by what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies or wayes of adminiſtration it ought to be attempted, when moſt weapons or medicines do little or nothing prevail againſt this inviolable enemy.<note place="margin">What, and what ſort of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines are good or hurtful in this Diſeaſe.</note> Phlebotomie aſſumes no place here, but is declined for the moſt part as prejudicial; alſo Cathar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, inſomuch as they provoke the affected fibres, and diſturb the Spirits, and hurry them more impetuouſly, do increaſe rather than diminiſh or cure the Tumour of the Belly; in like manner Diaphoreticks impell the Spirits and the morbific particles deeper into them, whereas they ought to be allured, and call'd out of the Fibres. The chief order of healing ſeems to be placed in Diureticks and the uſe of Clyſters; and alſo great things are expected from topical Applications, becauſe they are more immediately exhibited to the diſeaſe, and as it were by contact, and becauſe they do beſt diſcuſſe Tumours in other places. Yet not all Diſſolvents are here fitting, nor thoſe which profit moſt in other Tumours; for the more hot being given for diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, whether they are applyed by fomentation, Liniments, or in the form of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taplaſm or Plaiſter, oftner afford hurt than ſuccour in a Tympanie; for they both open and dilate the paſſages of the fibres, that from thence they may lye more open to the incurſion of the Spirits; and alſo rarifie the particles impacted, ſo that while they occupy a larger ſpace, an inflation and intumeſcency of the Belly is augmented. Laſtly, what appertains to Alteratives which ſuccour againſt other affections of the nervous kinde, only a certain few are fit in a Tympanie; for where the morbific matter ſticking within the ſtraiter paſſages cannot be impell'd ſtraight, or throughly, Elaſtick medicines render the ſtoppage greater and more fixt, by enfixing the matter deeper; wherefore Spirit of Harts-horn, of Soot, of Sal Armoniack, yea alſo Tinctures, Elixirs, and other Medicines endowed with a volatile Salt, or active particles of another kind, do not only acquire heat, and a troubleſome thirſt in the ſick perſon troubled with a Tympanie, but alſo cauſe the Abdomen to ſwell the more, inaſmuch as they melt the blood and nervous Juice, and ſtirre the Spirits, inſomuch that the particles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited by each of theſe, are compell'd into the parts affected.</p>
                        <p>But truly although Medicine doth ſo little avail againſt this diſeaſe,<note place="margin">Only mild Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient.</note> it is not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to be neglected, (as if either it effected nothing, or what is ill,) but it behooves us to turn every ſtone, that by ſome means we may ſuccour the Patient, and at length may obtain a cure for him, or at leaſt an alleviation. Wherefore in the firſt place (becauſe it is the cuſtom to begin with Purgatives) although the ſtronger do ever hurt, and the gentler ſcarce ever prevail to diſcharge the conjunct cauſe, notwithſtanding theſe latter, inaſmuch as they do ſomething ſubſtract the nouriſhment of the diſeaſe,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:40331:175"/> alſo make a way by which other Medicines do exert their powers, they ought to have their turns in phyſical practice once in ſix or ſeven dayes; and at other times let Clyſters (whoſe uſe is much better) be frequently adminiſtred. Hydroticks being prohibited, we muſt reſt upon moderate Diureticks, whereto are adjoyned things reſpecting the alteration and reduction of the Spirits and Humours, which truly make up the Tympanitical pharmacy. Moreover in the mean time the uſe of Topicks is not to be neglected. We will annex certain ſelect forms of Medicines appropriated for every of theſe purpoſes. For a Medicine mildly ſolutive, let the laxative Wine be uſed, preſcribed by the renowned <hi>Greg.

The ſecond <hi>Indication</hi> requires moſtly alterative Remedies, to wit,<note place="margin">The ſecond in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication.</note> thoſe which ſtop the fermentations of the humours in the bowels of the nether Belly, and the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaſms and irregular excurſions of the Spirits, alſo thoſe which procure equal mixtions and due motions of the Chyle and nervous Juice:<note place="margin">Of Chalybeate Medicines.</note> for which end Chalybeates are chiefly in uſe. And truly it is wont not only in this, but in many other ſplanchnical Diſeaſes, to have reſort to the Medicines of Iron, as if from thence to fetch the ſharpeſt weapons; whenas many Empiricks and Quacks, who preſcribe theſe things confidently and dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically, obſerve not by what way ſuch a Medicine doth operate, or what alterations for the better may be lawfully expected from thence: wherefore, while Iron, changed into Medicine, although the Sword of <hi>Goliah,</hi> is ſnatcht and brandiſht by a blind man, it is no marvel if it prove in vain, or if in the ſtead of the diſeaſe, which is an Enemy, Nature it ſelf is ſometimes hurt; and truly frequently it happens ſo, when Chalybeats, of which there is great variety, and diverſity of operations, are adminiſtred without any choice or difference either of the temperament or conſtitution in the Patient, and reſpect to the ſtate of the Diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>Of Medicines prepared of Iron or Steel,<note place="margin">What preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Iron are not convenient.</note> and of their vertues and manner of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we have in another place treated, and there is no need here to repeat the ſame things. For this diſeaſe, if any of them, not all of them are fit; for thoſe in which the frame of the mixture being opened, the Sulphur remains ſtill, and being looſened predominates over the reſt, they are altogether to be excluded from this number; for they do much ferment the Juices of the bowels with their notable fermentation, and do ſo exagitate the Blood and Spirits, that the whole Region of the nether Belly is lifted up into a greater bulk, as if by a certain Spirit thronging violently into it.</p>
                        <p>Neither here are they fit, from which the ſulphureous particles together with the ſaline are chaſed away, as in <hi>Crocus Martis</hi> prepared by long and ſtrong Calcination.

                           <note place="margin">What ſort may be admitted.</note>But there remains a Martial Remedy of a middle kind, wherein the Sulphur being wholly or for the moſt part expell'd, a vitriolie Salt remains and predominates: as indeed it is in the ſolution of the filings of Iron, or in a ſimple Infuſion, or in Mineral wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in the Salt or Vitriol of <hi>Mars,</hi> in our preparation of Steel, with many others; out of which medicines, being prepared or compounded, we find by often Experience that in ſome caſes, they contribute notable help. For theſe deſtroy the exotick ferments of the bowels, and reſtore the native ferments; they open their obſtructions, they fix the blood, and reſtrain its conſiſtence from too much diſſolution; wherefore Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybeate remedies, after the ſame manner as certain other alteratives, do perhaps ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing profit againſt the procatarctick, and more remote cauſes of a Tympany; but as to the conjunct cauſe, they contribute little or no ſuccour.</p>

                        <p>It differs from an Aſcites as to its outward form and appearance,<note place="margin">How it differs from an Aſcites.</note> yet not as to its morbific matter, which being the ſame in both diſtempers, as it is heaped within the greater or leſſer hollowneſſes, it gains divers Appellations of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.</p>
                        <p>The watery humour procuring an Anaſarca,<note place="margin">The Original from the blood.</note> doth proceed altogether or for the moſt part from the blood; for it being continually produced within the maſs of blood by the fault and defect of ſanguification, it is poured out in greater abundance from the extremities of the Arteries, than can be received, or brought back by the Veins, or the Lymphaducts, or can be diſcharged by the Reins or pores of the skin, and other vents of the ſerous Juice.</p>
                        <p>From theſe it follows, that the material cauſe of this Diſeaſe is a watery humour,<note place="margin">The material and efficient cauſe.</note> and the efficient is blood, which engenders waters and depoſits them in the places affected. We will exactly weigh the reaſons of either of them, and the manner of becoming and effecting it, and firſt we will treat of the efficient Cauſe of an Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarca.</p>

The affection of the Blood, or rather the Hydropical brood,<note place="margin">The Blood its efficient cauſe in a double reſpect.</note> conſiſts in theſe two things, to wit, Firſt by reaſon of a failure or fault of ſanguification, it doth not rightly aſſimilate the nutritious Juice perpetually infuſed into its maſs, but ſuffers it to degenerate into a watery humour: Then ſecondly by reaſon of the too looſe mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thereof, it doth not retain that humour, ſo degenerated, ſo long within its conſiſtence, untill it might be diſcharg'd through fit Emunctories or Emiſſaries, but lets it out every where near to the ends of the Arteries, into the inter-ſpaces of the Veſſels, and there leaves it. Either of theſe vices of the Blood we will conſider a little more.</p>
                        <p>In the firſt place as to the former, for the moſt part it is confeſſed by all,<note place="margin">Firſt that it doth not right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſanguifie.</note> that the Blood it ſelf and not the Heart or Liver ſanguifies, by what of late is plainly underſtood concerning the functions of theſe parts; yet by what means the Blood aſſimilates Chyle infuſed to it ſelf, and converts it into freſh blood, to be beſtowed to ſo many and diverſe ſorts of uſes, doth not eaſily lie manifeſt to us. But what ſome affirm, that it is made only by the exact comminution and commixtion of particles, and for that cauſe the particles of either kinde being confuſed together, they think, that within the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:40331:177"/> ſtraiter paſſages of the Liver and Lungs they are kneaded and wrought together as it were with little peſtils, ſeems little probable to me; but on the contrary, I think theſe bowels (as I have ſhewed already) are conſtituted the Organs rather of ſeparation than of mixture;<note place="margin">The reaſon whereof enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into.</note> but the reaſon of ſanguification altogether conſiſts in this, that the active particles of the old blood, to wit, the ſaline and ſulphureous, being placed in vigour with the ſpirituous, immediately act upon the like particles of the infuſed Chyle as yet exiſting in an inferiour ſtate, and do ſo ſtir them up and ferment them, that thereupon being extricated from the coverings of the thicker parts, they are carryed into a like degree of exaltation or perfection with the former, and being at length aſſociated with them, and made alſo homogeneous, they put on the ſame nature of Blood; the more thick and heterogeneous particles being removed thence to another place, from thoſe which they had deſerted and gone away from. For tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sanguification is altogether finiſht by Fermentation, even as the maturation of the Muſt into Wine or Ale; but the reaſon of the difference is, that Wine being ſhut up in the Tub, ſtill remaining entirely in the ſame Maſs, is ſlowly fermented, as to its whole conſiſtence, and is not accompliſhed but in a long ſpace of time; but the Blood conſtituted in a perpetual flux by the loſs of ſome parts and the reparation of others, is fermented by the parts ſtill received freſh, and is generated anew.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">The reaſon and manner of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guification ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.</note>The old Blood for the moſt part affords the ſame thing towards the freſh Chyle, as Ferment from the flower or faeces of old Ale, being put into new Ale; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding as it were by a contrary manner; becauſe the huge maſs of blood being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly fermented, doth ſuddenly ferment and alter the ſmall portions of the Chyle continually brought in; but the fermenting liquor in Ale in a very little quantity is put to the great maſs of the other liquor to be fermented; which it brings not to maturi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty under a long ſpace of time. After the rudiments of blood are ſo caſt by fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, the concluſion and perfect aſſimilation into blood, is acquired by accenſion; (for ſurely that it is ſo enkindled (as I think) I have formerly ſhewed by demonſtration, which arguments chiefly taken from its proper paſſion, although many have cavil'd at, none have been yet able to overthrow.) Wherefore, while the whole maſs of blood conſiſts of Blood and Chyle confuſedly mixt together, it is fermented while it is circulating; and being divided into moſt minute portions, is ſpread through the whole Lungs, that it might be kindled ſucceſſively according to all its parts, by the nitrous air ſuckt in: for by that means both the vital flame is continued, and all the particles of Blood having as it were paſſed the fire, become more purified, and more agreeable among themſelves; moreover, they are ſo diſpoſed of whileſt they are kindling, that while ſome go into Nouriſhment of the Spirits, of the Nervous Juice and the ſolid parts, and others leſs uſeful depart into the ferments or recrements of the bowels; mean while others being more fixt, abide longer in the maſs of blood, and ſuſtain its conſiſtence, and by fermenting the Nutritious Juice, ſtill engender new Blood, untill themſelves being impoveriſhed, are at length diſcarded, and give place to others that are freſh and luſtie.</p>

                           <note place="margin">Viz. Firſt from the defect or fault of its Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation;</note>Firſt therefore this happens more frequently and rather, for that the blood being depraved in its temperature, doth not rightly ferment the Nutritious Juice poured into it, that ſo it might be changed into laudable blood. For when the watery par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles predominate with the earthy in the maſs of Blood, the Salt and Sulphur being depreſſed with the Spirit, as all the functions, both Vital and Animal, from thence languiſh and waver; ſo eſpecially Sanguification it ſelf fails and is perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For the Juice of the Chyle commixt with the Blood, when it cannot be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and fermented, with the particles thereof, (after the faſhion of other liquors, as often as being mixt they want ferment,) it degenerates perhaps into a watery, acid, or ropy, or otherwiſe faulty humour, which being afterwards daily encreaſed, and at length riſing to its fulneſs, lyes heavy on the blood, and oft-times almoſt ſtifles its heat; from whence there is a neceſſity that it be forthwith diſcharged by ſome means, and whereſoever it can get vent; but afterwards for that the offices of ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration fail in their functions (the ſtock of the animal Spirits languiſhing by reaſon of the diminiſhed proviſion from the influxe of Blood,) the abounding Serum is depoſited
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:40331:177"/> every where into the pores, and next vacuities whether greater or leſſer, out of the little mouths of the Arteries; from whoſe daily and great encreaſe, after all the pores are filled, ariſes that as it were fenny habit call'd <hi>Anaſarca</hi> of the whole body out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, or of ſome of its members.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, not only the defect or fault of Fermentation,<note place="margin">Secondly, from defect of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion.</note> but alſo of the accenſion of the Blood, induces ſometimes an Hydropical diſpoſition on the maſs thereof: which is clearly diſcern'd, inaſmuch as ſome perſons inhabiting Maritime or mooriſh places, fall into the Dropſie without any other cauſe or occaſion, than that they draw a thicker air endowed with heterogeneous vapours, by which the Nitre is either driven away or obſcured. Therefore the blood becoming degenerate, and vitiated as to its temperature, becauſe it is not duely kindled, nor perfected by efflagration within the Precordia, doth not rightly diſſolve and aſſimilate the Juice of the Chyle, but ſuffers it to be perverted into a watery liquor. But although in the firſt place, the blood being depraved for this reaſon, ſometimes loſes its fermenting vertue, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the rather and more immediately procures a Dropſie; notwithſtanding it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, the firſt fault thereof aſſumes its origine from unwholſom air ſuckt in, and not duely enkindling the Blood; becauſe ſuch Hydropicks removing their reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence into Sunny and Mountainous places, recover their health without any other Medicines.</p>
                        <p>Hitherto of the neareſt Cauſes of an Anaſarca and which are conjoyned to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe it ſelf, which namely are the depravation or defect of the maſs of blood, chiefly as to its fermentation, and in ſome meaſure as to the enkindling thereof; which latter is ſcarce wont to be effective but when it follows the former: But what remains as to the more remote and procuring cauſes of this Diſeaſe, to wit, from which the defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentative affection ariſes (that I may ſay no more of the defect or depravation of its enkindling;) I ſay that theſe appear ſo diverſe and many, that I judge it hardly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to recite them all particularly; notwithſtanding, very many or at leaſt the chief may be reduced to theſe three heads: to wit,<note place="margin">Reduced to three heads.</note> For that the watery diſtemperament of the blood doth ariſe, inaſmuch as its active Principles, <hi>viz.</hi> Spirit, Salt and Sulphur, are not inveſted with their fermenting and ſanguifying force or vertue, I account this to come to paſs, either Firſt becauſe thoſe particles are too much waſted by their great expences; or Secondly becauſe they are not repaired by convenient and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate Refections; or Thirdly, for that they are overwhelmed or obſcured by ſome other duller or heterogeneous Particles being too much accumulated in the maſs of Blood: We will a little weigh the Reaſons and ways of each of theſe their coming to paſſe.</p>
                        <p>In the firſt place,<note place="margin">Firſt, becauſe the active par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the blood, are too much conſumed.</note> the former of theſe is evidently diſcerned in frequent and inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Haemorrhages, whereby many men, although ſtrong and formerly healthy, are immediately enclined to a Dropſie, more than from any other accident or occaſion; the reaſon whereof is, that the blood is ſo impoveriſhed, through its more noble Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles iſſuing out in great abundance, that afterwards it can neither duely ferment nor enkindle the Juice of the Chyle brought into it. Moreover, ſometimes the ſame effect ſucceeds (although in a more ſlow degree) from Feavers and other long mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and languiſhings; to wit, inaſmuch as the blood ſuffering under a long depreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is ſo extenuated and robb'd, that at length it becomes watery and defermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, the Blood ſometimes deſerting its genuine diſpoſition,<note place="margin">Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not enough re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired.</note> declines into an Hydropical one, for that the nouriſhment being more ſlender than it was wont, or ought to be beſtowed upon it, its active and ſanguifying Particles are not enough re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired within its maſſe; for ſo we have obſerved, that ſome who have uſed themſelves to Wine and ſtronger Drink, after they have been reduced to homely Diet, and ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler drink, of water or ſmall beer, ſuddenly have become Hydropick. It is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon obſervation, and frequently true, although of ill omen, that Drunkards, and daily drinkers, if that wild Cuſtom be left, at length becoming ſober and abſtemious, are much in hazard, leſt by reaſon of the uſual fermentation of the blood being depreſſed, they become obnoxious unto that Diſeaſe. I knew a notable Drunkard, who declared that a Prieſt very learned and Pious was guilty of his death, becauſe he gave him admonition to Temperance, and to leave his Drunkenneſs, and he complying therewith, incontinently fell into a mortal Dropſie.<note place="margin">Thirdly, becauſe they are buryed in duller par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>But the third cauſe or occaſion diſpoſing to that Diſeaſe, the moſt common and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, conſiſts in this, that the active Particles of the Blood, being involved with
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:40331:178"/> other more dull or heterogeneous ones, or being diſſipated from one the other, loſe their fermentative power, or cannot enough exerciſe it. But ſuch an affection of them, as it is wont to be raiſed from various cauſes and accidents, ſo chiefly from theſe, three,<note place="margin">Whereof there are three cauſes.</note> one while ſolitary, another while united together; to wit, Firſt from the Non-naturals immoderately received: Secondly from the Naturals unduely retain'd; or Thirdly, from the Preternaturals corruptly generated in the body.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Firſt from Non-naturals immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately ingeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note>The errors of Diet deſervedly may be referred to the firſt rank of theſe (whereby the ſtock of that Diſeaſe is always moſt abundant) For it is a common Prognoſtick and in every bodies mouth, that Gluttons and great Drunkards dye at length of a Dropſie: to which moreover, not only Surfeits and immoderate and daily Tiplings incline, but alſo frequent and unſeaſonable Treats; and moreover the continual pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of abſurd and hard to be digeſted Nouriſhment. For from the evil courſe of Diet of each kind uſed any while, whenas the Juice of the Chyle, oftentimes crude, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous, and above meaſure plentiful, is poured into the maſſe of blood, it of neceſſity follows, that it is firſt burdened, and afterwards its Conſiſtence being looſened, the more noble Particles being forced aſunder, it is ſo involved, or abated by the other heterogeneous ones, that being hindred, it deſiſts from its fermentative or ſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying virtue; inſomuch that the bowels being in a ſhort time hurt by its aſſaults, a Cachexia, and then a Dropſie followes, whereof that is alwayes a forerunner.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Secondly, From Naturals un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duely retained.</note>Secondly, in this place are put all ordinary, accuſtomed and ſolemn Evacuations ſuppreſſed. It is obſervable enough, that a Cachexie, and often a Dropſie, doth ariſe from a menſtruous or Hemorrhoidal flux diminiſhed or ſtopt, no leſs than from a too immoderate one, (by reaſon of the fermentation of blood impeded by the heterogeneity of Particles.) Moreover, the ſame is often wont to be effected from Iſſues ſuddenly ſtopt, or eruptions of the Skin ſuddenly repercuſs'd. Laſtly, ſuppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Urine, and ſweating much hindred, do render the blood more watery, by an immediate and neceſſary affection, and incline to the Dropſie. Alſo it is an obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion frequent enough of healthful Perſons, who being compelled for ſome time to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from going to Bed, that their feet have ſwoln.</p>

For this reaſon, nothing is more uſual than that Conſumptive perſons, and thoſe that are affected with ſtrumous and cancrous Ulcers, nay of any ſort within the Reins, Meſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, Guts, or other Bowels of the lower Belly, after they have been long conſuming, dye at length hydropical.</p>

                           <note place="margin">The material cauſe of an Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarca is partly the Serum of the Blood, and partly the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritious Juice.</note>Hitherto concerning the next efficient cauſe of this Diſeaſe, alſo of the chief re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote ones, as well procuring, as evident. But as to what appertains to the material cauſe, it is obvious unto the Senſe, that it is a meer Lympha accumulated within the pores of the Skin, and of the other outward parts; which being depoſited there by the blood (the liquor thereof being partly ſerous, and partly chylous Juice) but fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Sanguification and Nouriſhment of the body, to which it was deſtinated, it is caſt off like recrements into the vacuous ſpaces of every veſſel. And though the matter of the Dropſie proceed from the Blood and Chyle, yet it is no wonder if it appear nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like blood, nor milkie, but only limpid; becauſe the Urine even of healthful people, after more plentiful drinking, is rendred crude as well as watery; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is manifeſt, it is nothing changed by the blood, but leaves in that place, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever of colour or thicker conſiſtence it brings to its maſſe. And although a reaſon may be given in either caſe, that the Urine, inaſmuch as it is ſtreined through the Kidneys, and the hydropic matter thorough the pores of the ſolid parts, even ſo become limpid and watery; notwithſtanding it is evident by obſervation, that the watery part of the Chyle, even while it is confounded with the blood, is not inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately mixt with it, but being deprived of its colour and conſiſtency, it remains under
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:40331:178"/> the form of Lympha, within the pores of the blood; the ſure ſign of which is, that the blood taken from any Animal by Phlebotomy, after being cold it is divided into parts,<note place="margin">Why the hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick humour is limpid and not milkie nor bloody.</note> exhibits a watery liquor (which conſiſts of Serum and Nutritious Juice) plainly limpid, and ſeparate from the other blood. It will be from our preſent purpoſe to enquire any further into the reaſons hereof, and manner of being ſo, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore blood, which being poured into water doth preſently tinge the ſame, and bloodies all ſolid bodies whenſoever it is ſprinkled thereon, yet dyes the Serum of no colour with which it is intimately confounded and a long time circulated.</p>
                        <p>From the Aetiologie of this diſeaſe now delivered,<note place="margin">The Differences of the Diſeaſe.</note> the differences of it may eaſily be collected; to wit, firſt it is either univerſal, when the whole habit of the body and all the members ſwell up; or it is particular, wherein for the moſt part the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour members only ſuffer, in the mean time the reſt of the body pining away for want of Nouriſhment, which kind of diſtemper, and not a Tympanie, <hi>Proſper Martianus</hi> will have <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſtyle the dry Dropſie, in which what is reported of the Syren, the dry is joyned to the watery.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, an Anaſarca whether univerſal or particular, is either ſimple or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated with an Aſcites; and then either an Anaſarca enſues an Aſcites, or this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe follows that. Moreover an Anaſarca may be diſtinguiſhed many ways in reſpect as well of the procatarctick as evident cauſes, as we have before intimated; and ſuch differences thereof are found to be frequently of great moment about duely inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Prognoſtick and Cure.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore, what relates to the prognoſtick part, this diſeaſe while it is ſimple,<note place="margin">The Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks of it.</note> proves leaſt dangerous among all the kinds of Dropſies; and a particular one ſeiſing only the inferiour members, ſo that the belly doth not together ſwell with them, is much ſafer than an univerſal one.</p>
                        <p>An Anaſarca bringing on an Aſcites, wherein for the moſt part the Urine is plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful enough, and the thirſt not very intenſe, is far more ſafe than an Anaſarca brought in by an Aſcites, wherein the diſeaſed do very much thirſt, and make little, red, and thick, and for the moſt part a lixivial Urine. In like manner it is, or worſe, when an Anaſarca comes upon a Tympanie or a Phthiſis (as ſometimes 'tis wont.) Laſtly, no ſlight Prognoſtick of this diſeaſe is taken from the complyance, or the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinateneſs of the Patient, about Diet and Medicine. For whatſoever the condition of the diſeaſe may be, if the hydropick perſon refuſing medicine will indulge his fancy, we may not hope any good from thence.</p>
                        <p>About the Curatory part to be deſigned in order,<note place="margin">The Cure of it. Two Indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> two chief Scopes of Healing do occurre, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, that the water between the skin be conſumed by ſome means; Secondly, then proviſion muſt be made, leſt it be continually generated and accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated afreſh; for which purpoſe a Phyſitian is to employ his labour, both that the bowels of Concoction being emptyed of their Superfluities, and free from obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, may always procure laudable Chyle, and ſupply the maſſe of blood in due plenty; as alſo that the blood (the principles thereof being reſtored to its fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive power) may orderly ferment the Juice of the Chyle continually poured into it, and aſſimilate it into Blood. The vital Indication ſeems not at all neceſſary in this diſeaſe as in many others, for that very rarely in this appear ſwoonings of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, or Watchings, for which Cordials and Hypnoticks are required; and there is little need of reſtoring Diets, becauſe Faſting and Abſtinence rather help, and oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times make up the greateſt part of the Cure: the reaſon whereof is, that the Veſſels being emptyed through want, do ſwallow up the waters between the skin, or ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating in other places, and do diſcharge them forth partly by the Kidnies, by the pores of the skin and other Emunctories, and partly do advantageouſly employ them being yet turgid with alimentary Juice, to the nouriſhing of the body.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, That the firſt <hi>Indication</hi> being Curatory,<note place="margin">The firſt intends the evacuation of the morbific matter.</note> intending an Evacuation of the morbific matter, may be performed, there ought to be exhibited all Hydragogue medicins, as well ſimple as compound; and alſo the forms of medicines recounted and preſcribed in the former Chapter of an Aſcites. Moreover, hereto belong not only Catharticks and Diureticks, but alſo Diaphoreticks, which though in other ſorts of Dropſies they are very much forbidden, often take place in curing of an Anaſarca.</p>
                        <p>In a ſimple Anaſarca we may lawfully adminiſter ſtrong Purgers,<note place="margin">By Purgers.</note> and frequently they much profit. And truly this Diſeaſe being cured ſometimes by means of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thartick, Empiricks do much glory of their Cures, and certain of their medicines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come much cryed up for curing hydropical perſons; for if at any time it happens
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:40331:179"/> that they have healed one or two labouring with an Anaſarca, by their ſpecifick Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dragogues and Elateriums, it is enough wherewith they may always magnifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their Art, although by the ſame medicine they have murdered a hundred Aſcitical perſons.<note place="margin">Strong Purgers are convenient but not to all.</note> Wherefore, although Preparations of Spurge, or <hi>Elaterium, Pilu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lae Lunares, Hercules Bovii,</hi> and other Hydragogues, have ſometimes profited in ſome caſes; notwithſtanding if they be indifferently exhibited to all Hydropicks, or at all to any endowed with a weak Conſtitution, and Bowels of a brittle tone, or of evil conformation, they oftener cauſe death than remedy: wherefore let it always be committed to the judgment of a prudent Phyſitian, the time when, how long, and what ſort of Catharticks are to be uſed.</p>
                        <p>We have before deſcribed forms of Hydragogue Purgers of every ſort, to wit, thoſe that exerciſe their power upwards and downwards, and as well mild as ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er workers, ſo that they may be referred hither, and accommodated to the method of healing now propoſed.</p>

                           <note place="margin">The manner of their working.</note>But if the reaſon be enquired, after what manner Purgers do operate in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, and why they more happily, and much more efficaciouſly bring out waters than in any other ſorts of Dropſie; I ſay, in an Anaſarca the morbific matter (which is the Lympha) ſubſiſts partly in the maſs of blood, partly in the habit of the body, within the pores and vacuities between the ends of the veſſels; wherefore, a ſtrong Cathartick being adminiſtred, preſently troubles and diſſolves the maſs of blood, and ſtirres it up to the excretion of any ſuperfluous or heterogeneous thing; and irritates alſo the little mouths of the Arteries gaping towards the Cavities of the Inteſtines, that the humour ejected from the blood may eaſier find vent through theſe Emunctories. From hence in the firſt place, the waters fluctuating within the blood are abundantly drained out, afterwards the veſſels being emptyed, do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſwallow up again the waters between the skin, and preſently diſcharge them forth partly by ſiege, and partly by Urine, or Sweat; in the mean time there is no fear leſt, as in an Aſcites, the morbific matter being driven and poured from the blood, by the Medicine, ſhould be further forced into the places affected, whence not eaſily flowing back again, it ſhould be more largely encreaſed; nor leſt, as in a Tym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, by reaſon of the Fibres of the Stomach and Guts being too much irritated by the Phyſick, thoſe bowels might be provok'd into convulſive ſwellings. For as long as the bowels are firm and well conſtituted, the particles of the Medicine inflict them with no hurt; but preſently being brought into the blood, they do not only allure waters out of it, but by exagitating the maſs thereof, they raiſe the active particles formerly overwhelmed, and diſpoſe them towards their fermentative power.</p>

Frictions do frequently afford advantagious ſucceſs in a Leucophlegmatia and an Anaſarca: for when the habit of the body is not only filled with a watery il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luvies gathered there together, ſo that nothing can evaporate, but that the extern parts grow cold by reaſon of the approach of blood towards them being ſtopt, often and ſtrong frictions do move together the ſtagnating waters, and diſſipate them from thence in ſome meaſure, and alſo recall again the blood by opening the paſſages into thoſe parts from whence it was baniſhed; wherefore, not only the ſwoln members, but alſo the whole body once or twice in a day, is expedient to be rubbed with a courſe Cloth, or with a little Bruſh now ordinarily prepared for that purpoſe.</p>

With or after Frictions, Liniments and Fomentations are ſometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient. They are prepared either of Salts, and other Minerals diſſolv'd, or from hot and diſcuſſing Vegetables, with the faeces of Wine boyl'd in water, the hot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication whereof opens the pores, moves together more amply the accumulated wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and diſcuſſes them, and alſo enlarges the compaſs of the bloody Circuit, the watery heap being ſomewhat diſſipated. Let the Liniments conſiſt of Sulphur, and Salts of a diverſe kind, or of Quick-lime, and other Minerals, which being powdered and mixed with the mucilaginous Extracts of ſharp Herbs, are reduced into the form of an Unguent; to which let a fit quantity of Oyl of Scorpions be added, for the better conſiſtency. Moreover this Oyl (ſo it be genuine) applyed by it ſelf, doth frequently afford notable help. I knew a Boy much ſwell'd with an univerſal Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarca, who was cured by this Remedy alone: for his mother (I know not by whoſe advice) anointed his whole body morning and evening with Oyl of Scorpions, ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rubbing all the parts with her hot hand; by which act within three dayes he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to pour forth abundance of Urine, and when he had continued piſſing ſo for ſome dayes, the ſwelling vaniſhing by little and little, he became ſound.</p>

                           </note>4. Baths are not convenient in any Dropſie but an Anaſarca, and not for this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in a Diatheſis or Declination. For ſeeing the Blood from the heat thereof, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſing the whole Body, being made boyling and ſtirr'd up, every where puts in motion the waters formerly ſtagnating, and ſwallowing them up into it ſelf, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys them variouſly away; the danger is, leſt (as frequently it falls out) receiving them out of the habit of the body into its own maſs, it ſhould depoſe them preſently into the Praecordia or the Brain: for there is nothing more uſual than an affection of thoſe parts, <hi>viz.</hi> an Aſthma or Apoplexie to come upon Hydropicks by unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able bathing. But when the conjunct cauſe of the diſeaſe (<hi>viz.</hi> a Swelling) becomes moderate, or not much, a Bath of water impregnated with Salts and Sulphur, or a Hot-houſe, by which a gentle Sweat is promoted, is frequently adminiſtred with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs: As for the Stew it is more expedient, and oft-times notably helps, that the Patients be placed in fitting Seats in Salt-houſes, near the Furnaces wherein Mineral Waters are boyled into Salt.</p>

Touching the manner how they operate we will treat more ſpecially here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; in the mean time we adviſe, that they are very cautiouſly to be exhibited to Hydropicks, for that Epiſpaſticks of this kind, applyed to the ſwell'd places, do make the Emiſſarie too open, by which apertion the water in the firſt place burſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, draws oftentimes a great illuvies after it from the neighbouring parts, whence immediately enſues a great proſtration of the Spirits. Moreover, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the place is ſo ſuddenly emptyed, that being deſtitute of heat and ſpirits, it is in a ſhort time ſphacelated or mortified; wherefore this Medicine is ſeldom ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the Legs, or the Feet of Hydropical perſons, where the heat is weak, and the humour greateſt, but ſometimes to the Thighs and Arms with ſecurity (as often as there ſhall be need.)</p>

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:40331:180"/> ſtream, which Nature (after that by degrees it is accuſtomed thereunto) endures the better. Moreover, there is leſs fear of a Gangrene from an Eſcharotick than from a Veſicatory, becauſe in that application the part, whoſe union is diſſolved, is defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Eſchar againſt the loſs of heat. I have known ſometimes an illiterate and rude Empirick, who frequently by an Eſcharotick did evacuate with ſucceſs the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of hydropick perſons, however ſwell'd, by the enſuing manner: to wit, he fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the legs evening and morning with the Decoction of Dwarf-Elder,<note place="margin">The empirical manner of Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charoticks.</note> Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, Cammomile and other hot herbs put into the Lees of Ale or Wine; and between the times of the Fomentations he applyed a Cataplaſm prepared of the maſſe of that Decoction with Bran; after he had uſed theſe for three dayes, he co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered both legs and feet with a Plaiſter of <hi>Burgundy</hi> Pitch, leaving only a ſmall hole on each Calf, about the bigneſs of a Nut, in which places he put an Eſcharo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, on the bare skin, of the Aſhes of Aſhen-bark: which after twelve hours being removed, a ſmall Eſchar was left, from whoſe pores water was wont at firſt ſlowly to ſweat out, afterwards day by day a little more plentifully to drop out, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward (the Eſchar falling off) it uſed to flow out more abundantly as from an open Spring untill it had drein'd the whole leg both beneath and above.</p>

                              <hi>7.</hi> Pricking with a Needle.</note> There remains another manner (not inferiour though leſs uſed than the former) of draining out the waters between the skin, <hi>viz.</hi> by the pricking of a Needle; which likewiſe ought cautiouſly, and minutely to be uſed, leſt a headlong and too great efflux of waters be provok'd thereby. Take an ordinary Needle (ſuch as Taylors uſe) and let it be thruſt into the skin, pricking over the place chiefly ſwelled, only ſo far that blood follow not: and ſo at one time let ſix or ſeven little holes be made, a thumbs breadth diſtant from each other; from every little hole the water will iſſue forth by drops, and ſo it will contiually drop out untill all the ſwelling vaniſh about the place ſo pricked; afterwards, the next time after twelve hours, another while after 18 or 24 hours, let the ſame pricking be exerciſed in another part of the ſame thigh, or of the other; and afterwards once or twice a day in this or that member, or in both together, or in more places, let ſuch Emiſſaries of the water between the skin be excited. For in truth after this manner the hydropick illuvies may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted more plentifully and ſafely than from any other outward Chirurgery; In the mean time if the new proviſion thereof be provided againſt by inward Phyſick, the diſeaſe will be the eaſier cured. Moreover in a deſperate Dropſie life is beſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed by ſuch an adminiſtration, for that the waters being exhauſted continually by thoſe outward Emiſſaries, the inner inundation of life is longer protracted. Not long ſince an old man aged ſeventy years, overwhelmed with a Dropſie over his whole body, by the help of this Remedy only, remained living for many moneths beyond expectation, and raiſed his head above the waters.</p>

                           <note place="margin">Phlebotomie a very general and ancient medicine.</note>AMong the univerſal Documents of Philoſophie, or aids or Phyſick, none either in Theory or Practice hath been more ancient or general than the ſpeculation of the Blood and letting it out by opening a Vein. As to the former we have in other places often explicated the nature and conſtitutive parts of the Blood, we have unfolded the Virtues and Energy of the ſame, and have demonſtrated that it is in truth enkindled, and that from the burning thereof the flame of animal life, as of a Lamp, doth begin and receives continuation: But as to what relates to Phlebotomie, all Authors of every age have made mention thereof: Moreover the ſame was ever in Medicinal uſe with all Nations howſoever barbarous or rude. Neither is it a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for truely Nature it ſelf in the firſt place hath taught the neceſſity, and way of that part of Chirurgery; Even the Divine Law commanding the Rite of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, as a Symbol thereof, ſeems to intimate that the innate impurities of Humane Nature ought to be purged in ſome manner by letting out the blood.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Nature ſhews it by Haemorrha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies.</note>That we may methodically diſcourſe of this great Remedie, we ought firſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, by what means, alſo for what cauſes and ends, the letting of blood either hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens ſpontaneouſly to Nature, or is indicated by the Phyſitian; then ſecondly we will annex the chief effects of this Evacuation, as well good as bad, whether advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous or diſadvantageous, and together propound certain Rules and Cautions to be obſerved, about due adminiſtration of Phlebotomie.</p>
                        <p>As to the former, ſpontaneous Haemorrhagies (which ſuggeſt the uſe of Phlebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy) whereas they are manifold and of diverſe kinds, they are uſually reduced to theſe two heads or ranks: to wit, they are denominated either critical, Nature en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring ſomething good and wholſome; or ſymptomatical, which for the moſt part happen, ſhe being dejected from her government, and being altogether out of order.<note place="margin">Critical either with or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a feaver.</note> The bloody eruptions of the former kind are again diſtinguiſhed; that they are either raiſed without a Feaver, and are either periodical, which happen often at ſet ſeaſons, as the Flowers in Women, and the Hemorrhoids in ſome, and in others the ſolemn or otherwiſe accuſtomed opening of the Noſtrils; which very often ſucceed according to the great changes of the Year, or alterations of the Air; or they are fleeting and uncertain, as when blood doth advantageouſly break out of thoſe places, and of many others, one while in this part, another while in that part of the body. Moreover, bloody Criſes do ſometimes happen in a Feaver, and do often put an end to it, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> long ago obſerved, and is now manifeſt by very common ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. The blood breaks out in all theſe caſes, inaſmuch as being turgid, and above meaſure rarified within the veſſels, it deſires a larger ſpace, wherefore, unleſs ſome portion thereof give way, the whole maſs runs the hazard of being conſtipated, and as well the motion thereof to be hindered, as the enkindling to be ſuffocated, and the temperature to be perverted.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">The cauſes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of proceed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</note>For there are two chief Reaſons or Cauſes, wherefore ſuch turgeſcencies of the Blood do ariſe: inaſmuch as its liquor is as well inflammable, as fermentative.</p>
                        <p n="1">
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>1.</hi> From the kindling of the blood.</note>1. As to the former of theſe, that the Blood may be duely enkindled for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting Life, and the due exerciſe of the functions thereof, it behoves that the innate ſulphureous particles of it be proportion'd unto the Nitrous adventitious ones from the Air. Therefore as often as the Blood being very boyling and rarified, is much opened and looſened in its own conſiſtence, ſo that the Sulphur being diſſolved, is kindled in greater plenty, there is a moſt frequent and painfull breathing inſtituted for the drawing in of a more plentifull Nitre. Now if the Sulphur abounding in this manner, cannot be waſted by burning, nor the vital flame regulated, the next courſe immediately to diminiſh the ſulphureous fuel, is, that a certain portion of the rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Blood have vent. From hence, not only in Feavers, but after drinking Wine, Bathings, being in the Sun, and other accidents by which the Blood grows very tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, either an Haemorrhagia of its own accord ſucceeds, or there is often need to ſupply the defect of ſuch a ſpontaneous evacuation by Phlebotomie. But that ſuch
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:40331:182"/> kind of effuſions of Blood, whether made by Nature or Chirurgery, are commonly reported to bridle its heat or raging; really they do this only inaſmuch as they diminiſh the kindling of the blood, by withdrawing part of the ſulphureous fuel, as Oyl from a Lamp.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. But moreover in the ſecond place, the Blood,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>2.</hi> From its Fermentation.</note> inaſmuch as it is a fermentative liquor, it is apt alſo to be extravaſated. Namely, if at any time any heterogeneous thing, and not miſcible, be confounded with its liquor, it grows hot very much, like Wine in a Veſſel, and boyls up in the Veſſels to exclude that diſagreeable thing, which if it can neither ſubdue, nor turn off by Sweat, Urine, or otherwiſe, the Blood it ſelf excludes part of it ſelf as a Vehicle for carrying that matter forth, whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a vent is to be found. For this reaſon (<hi>viz.</hi> that any diſagreeable or indomita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing may be turn'd out of the maſs of blood) divers ſorts of Hemorrhagies hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, as well in Feavers as without them; all which are excited by Nature for an intention of good, as alſo thoſe by which the too much enkindling of the Blood is depreſſed: But that frequently it happens otherwiſe, ought to be imputed to divers accidents and circumſtances. But for the moſt part the failure about the ſpontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Hemorrhagies critically inſtituted,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>1.</hi> Critical Hemorrhagies ſometimes turn into ſympto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical.</note> is either in the firſt place becauſe the blood while it is boyling knows no meaſure of flowing out, and therefore being ſtirr'd into violence, it flows out too much; or ſecondly, becauſe the mouths of the veſſels once opened do not preſently cloſe again, nor are able to be ſhut; or Thirdly, becauſe Nature endeavouring an excretion of blood, doth it by places more open, but often inconvenient; as when an Hemorrhage happens through the Lungs, the Kidneys, Guts, or other Bowels, which therefore paſs from a Critical into a Symptomical and often into a malignant Haemorrhage.</p>
                        <p>Neither only by theſe means, but by many other failings of Nature,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>2.</hi> Symptoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Hemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhagies ariſe either,</note> or impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, do Symptomatical Haemorrhagies happen, in all which either the Blood it ſelf, or the Veſſels containing it, or both of them together, are wont to be chiefly in fault.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. In the firſt place, the Blood, beſides the reaſons above mentioned, (to wit,<note place="margin">Firſt by the fault of the blood.</note> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as it becomes inflammable or fermentable above meaſure) is apt alſo to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travaſated, becauſe either its liquor being empoiſoned, or otherwiſe corrupted, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not retain its due mixture, but being apt to coagulate or putrifie, divides it ſelf into parts; and whilſt ſome of them being here and there planted, ſending forth ſpots, wheals, and other brands of Malignity, do diſcolour the Fleſh and the Skin, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the proper paſſages; others otherwiſe running out and breaking forth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever there is a vent found, do produce bloody Excretions in divers places, as is commonly diſcerned in the Plague, Small-pox, Meaſles, and malignant Feavers; yea perhaps this in ſome meaſure is the reaſon why in ſcorbutick Diſtempers, as ſpots and marks, ſo alſo Haemorrhagies are ſo familiar.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Secondly, The veſſels bringing Blood being faulty many and divers ways,<note place="margin">Secondly, The fault of the Veſſels, for that they are ill formed.</note> but chiefly in theſe three, do appear the cauſe of a ſymptomatical Haemorrhage, <hi>viz.</hi> In the firſt place, if perhaps any where ſome of them are obſtructed, as often as the blood aſſumes a more rapid motion, either in the ſame place, or in the contiguous parts, and alſo ſometimes in remote parts it is conſtrained to burſt out. Frequently from ſuch a cauſe an Haemoptoe proceeds; moreover Spitting of blood, and the Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhage of the Noſtrils do often follow the ſuppreſſion of the Terms and Hemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoids. Secondly, the little mouths of the veſſels (by reaſon of the fleſhy Fibres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing looſened or reſolved by which they are clos'd) ſometimes are ill formed, ſo that when the ends of the Arteries do gape too much, the little mouths of the veins do cloſe. By reaſon of this affection, Scorbutical and Cachectical perſons, are found ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to Haemorrhagies, as we have remarkt in another place. But Thirdly,<note place="margin">Thirdly, Foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they are convulſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected.</note> it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently comes to paſs that the Veſſels, being ſo evilly formed, are alſo convulſively affected, and ſo the morbific cauſe being as it were doubled, this evil is much encreaſed, inſomuch that the muſcular fibres of the Veſſels being inordinately contracted, cauſe ſudden and violent fluxes of the blood, one while towards the upper parts, another while towards the lower; and ſo their little mouths being open in the mean time, they provoke prodigious Haemorrhagies. For I have obſerved in ſome perſons, when the current of blood was ſmall enough, with a ſmall and weak pulſe, the Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Veſſels generated in ſome place, and propagated under the likeneſs of wind running to and fro in the body, to drive more impetuouſly the blood, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſlow of it ſelf, and to conſtrain it into violent eruptions; and in caſes of this
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:40331:183"/> ſort, when Phlebotomies and Medicines refrigerating and tempering the blood have not at all profited, the greateſt relief hath been found from Narcoticks, Antiſpaſmodicks and Ligatures.</p>
                        <p n="3">
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>3.</hi> From the blood and veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels being both in fault.</note>3. Thirdly, If perhaps it ſhall happen that theſe faults of the Blood and Veſſels are complicated, and put forth their miſchiefs joyntly at once; from thence it will be of neceſſity that this evil will be more intenſe, and more frequent and prodigious Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhagies will be raiſed; the reaſons of which as they appear plain enough by what goes before, it will be neither neceſſary nor ſeaſonable here longer to dwell upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicating of them; but rather, whereas we have deſigned hitherto the acts of Nature about ſpontaneous effuſion of Blood, and its courſes both rightly inſtituted, and alſo wrongfully and evilly conſtrained; now it behoves us next to declare, how far Art (for the moſt part the Ape of Nature, and ſometimes Miſtris or Moderatrix thereof,) can act likewiſe well, or better about letting of blood, and how ſometimes it is wont to ſucceed worſe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Emiſſion of the Blood procured by art.</note>We advertiſe of theſe things in general, that a Phyſitian imitates Nature in ſome caſes of letting blood, exceeds her in other caſes, and frequently regulates and reduces her when acting amiſs. Moreover, there are ſome caſes wherein Nature excells far the efficacy of Art concerning bloody excretions; briefly of each of theſe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>1.</hi> It either imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates Nature.</note>Therefore in the firſt place, in whatever affects, ſpontaneous Haemorrhagies are wont to bring help, when theſe are wanting, Phyſick the Handmaid of Nature rightly ſubſtitutes Phlebotomie. Therefore, if perchance the Blood be immoderately kindled by reaſon of its Sulphur being too much looſened and advanc'd, by breathing a vein, what is ſuperfluous of that inflammable fuel will flow out, as alſo the immoderate turgeſcency of Blood, by reaſon of ſomewhat untamable being mixed with it, will be allay'd by this courſe. Wherefore letting of blood is advantageouſly adminiſtred, as well againſt continual Feavers, which proceed from the former cauſe, as inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittent Feavers, whoſe fits proceed from the latter cauſe. Alſo in like manner, as often as an accuſtomed evacuation being ſuppreſſed, or a humour driven back from the outward parts, or a ſudden ſtoppage of the pores, or if a Surfeit, drinking of Wine, or other accidents of this nature, cauſe a turgeſcency of blood (inaſmuch as they daſh heterogeneous particles againſt it) Phlebotomie is uſually the moſt ready Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>2.</hi> Or excells and regulates it.</note>Secondly, Phyſick in Blood-letting, not only imitates Nature, but often excells it; and alſo ſuccours her being weakened, and reduces her often erring. For if at any time the blood ſtruck with violence, ruſhes in a heap againſt any part, and either preſently breaks out in the ſame place, or abundantly gathered together engenders an Inflammation, a vein being pierced in a remote place, ſtops that preternatural ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of the blood, and frequently carryes away the bleeding, or inflammation. Wherefore, in a Pleuriſie, a Squinancy, a Peripneumonia, in ſpitting or vomiting of blood, when Nature is vanquiſhed, or being outragious, ſeems to caſt violent hands upon her ſelf, Chirurgery recalling the blood to another part, and ſending it out, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtores the matter that was almoſt deſperate.</p>
                        <p>Moreover Phyſick frequently reſtrains or reduces Nature, when too prodigal or prevaricating in pouring out of the blood: for in truth all immoderate Haemorrhagies do want Bridles, not Spurs. But in the Plague, Small-pox and Meaſles broke out, and in malignant Feavers, ſometimes the blood ſpontaneouſly flowing out, portends for the moſt part evil; therefore in thoſe affects ſtyptic Remedies, or things ſtopping the eruption of blood, are more convenient than breathing of a Vein.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>3.</hi> Or Art out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done by Nature.</note>Thirdly, Notwithſtanding on the contrary there are caſes of ſhedding blood by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which Phyſick can no way imitate, neither if they chance to fail, can be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed by Phlebotomy. In Feavers about the Criſis of the Diſeaſe, to wit, after the digeſtion of the matter, that is to ſay, the preparation for Excretion, ſpontaneous Haemorrhagies if coming in time, do far excell any Phlebotomie which none knows the beſt ſeaſon of; Moreover, the Fluxes of the Terms and Haemorrhoids happening by Natures inſtinct, are more advantageous than the miſſion of blood provok'd by Art in any of thoſe places.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Phlebotomy and ſpontaneous He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhagies dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer as to the ſubject and matter.</note>Between Phlebotomie and ſpontaneous Haemorrhagies, there is yet a notable diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, (although not of great moment in Phyſical practice) <hi>viz.</hi> both as to the Subject and Matter of either of them; for in this the blood being florid, and throughly Scarlet, doth for the moſt part only flow out of the Arteries, but in the other Evacuation the Blood being of a black purple with a Scarlet Cream, is only drawn out of the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:40331:183"/> vein. Whence the ſtream of Blood, which is one within all the veſſels and throughout continuous, acquires ſuch a diverſe kind of appearance, ſeeing we have ſhewed in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, it is not our preſent purpoſe to make any further ſearch into this Aetiolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie; becauſe it concerns not much to the curing any diſtemper, out of what veſſel the blood be let, provided it flow out largely: But that the ancients do in ſome caſes commend Arteriotomie, and prefer it to an inciſion of a vein, the Circulation of Blood not being then known, we have elſewhere diſcourſed how well it may be done.</p>
                        <p>Hitherto of Phlebotomie compared with a ſpontaneous Haemorrhage;<note place="margin">The uſe and effects of Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botomy.</note> now our next buſineſs is, to deſcribe the uſe and effects thereof, as well good as bad, in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical practice. Wherefore we will firſt ſhew in general what alteration of the maſs of Blood this Evacuation brings; then what diſeaſes it more immediately reſpects, either of the whole body, or its particular parts.</p>
                        <p>About the former,<note place="margin">How it affects and alters the Blood.</note> it is obvious enough that the blood is altered by breathing a vein, both as to its quantity and temperament, and as to its diſpoſition and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>The firſt and moſt common Indication of Phlebotomie, is,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>1.</hi> Diminiſhes its quantity.</note> that the plenty of blood be diminiſhed by this Adminiſtration. And truly this is a vulgar Remedy, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move or provide againſt a Plethora. Any one, though of the vulgar ſort, growing to a full habit of body, lets blood without the advice of a Phyſitian; Moreover Ruſticks and Countrey-men for healths ſake,<note place="margin">Emiſſion of the Blood is not to be either too prodigally, or too ſlenderly made.</note> once or twice in a year cauſe blood to be drawn from themſelves and their Beaſts. But although this cuſtom is grown ſo much in uſe with ſome prodigal of their blood, that they breathe a Vein on the ſmalleſt occaſion, and ſometimes without any manifeſt cauſe; notwithſtanding we may find many others no leſs obſtinate againſt this cuſtome, inſomuch that for no cauſe will they loſe any blood, unleſs the greateſt neceſſities be urgent.</p>
                        <p>Upon this matter (whereas Arguments are alleadged on either part,<note place="margin">The reaſons of the former hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at.</note>) that I may in few words determine what ſeems fit to be ordained, in the firſt place it is requiſite we grant, that letting blood is convenient againſt a Plethora either made, or begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: for by no other Remedy are the evils of that Affection wont to be better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved or provided againſt. Notwithſtanding, the neceſſity of this evacuation ought to be declined as much as may be; becauſe from thence (as we have intimated elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where) the blood becomes more ſulphureous, and leſs ſalt, and for that reaſon it moſt commonly diſpoſes all men to be feaveriſh and to be fat. Moreover the Great Remedy Blood-letting, if it be proſtituted to every little occaſion, becomes leſs efficacious to any grand affections when need requires: To which we may adde, that according to the vulgar obſervation, by how much the more familiarly any one uſes Phlebotomy, he will the more frequently ſtand in need of it: for blood being emitted to avoid a Plethora, the reſt of the maſs will the ſooner riſe to a Plethora: far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than is the opinion of ſome, who dread leſt the ſtore of blood be conſumed by frequent Phlebotomie; for that on the contrary by this means the quantity is more encreaſed, although the Craſis be the worſer: for ſo the blood having loſt much of its balſamick Salt, and preſervative againſt putrefaction, inſtead thereof, is filled with a pinguifying and more fiery Sulphur.</p>

                              <hi>2.</hi> Phlebotomie amends the mixture of the Blood.</note> Phlebotomie doth frequently correct the mixture and temperament of the blood in a manifold reſpect. For in the firſt place, if any thing heterogeneous be confounded with its maſs, which cannot be rightly digeſted, nor eaſily excerned and ſent away: a Vein being opened, the blood flowing out conveyes frequently much of the portion of that matter forth with it, inſomuch that the reſt may be either ſubdued or expell'd. For the orifice of a veſſel being opened, preſently the blood fermenting gathers together the extraneous particles as much as poſſible, and excludes that portion of it ſelf wherein many of them are heaped up: From hence we may obſerve the blood flowing out firſt and laſt to be well enough,<note place="margin">It reſtores its temper.</note> when that emitted between appears corrupt. Alſo ſecondly, the blood declining from its tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament, is frequently reſtored by Phlebotomie. For when the maſs thereof by the Sulphur or fixt Salt, or both together being exalted, ſhall degenerate into ſharp, ſalt, or ſaline-ſulphureouſneſs, a portion of the blood being withdrawn, immediately a new fermentation thereof ariſes, and very often there is a tranſpoſition made of all the particles of that ſort, that afterwards the Spirits may a little emerge with the volatile Salt, and recover their dominion, the Sulphur, and fixt Salt (as is fitting) being ſubdued. For this reaſon it is that letting Blood doth not only confer great
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:40331:184"/> help in Feavers, but alſo in the Scurvy, Jaundies, and beginning Conſumption; for the blood after the veſſels are emptyed, like the Stomach disburden'd, doth better digeſt and aſſimilate any humours ingeſted, and the more eaſily throws off and ſeparates what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is heterogeneous.</p>

                           <note place="margin">Some diſtempers of the blood ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit not Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botomy.</note>But if the mixture of Blood begins to be much looſned and become very bad, as in the Plague and malignant Feavers, we muſt altogether abſtain from Phlebotomie; for the blood being withdrawn, the ſtore of Spirits (whoſe only part it is to vindicate the maſs of blood from putrefaction and corruption) is diminiſhed, ſo that immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately all things tend to a deadly diſſolution. Moreover, if the Dyſcraſie of the blood ſhall be of that manner, that the more noble Principles, to wit, the Spirit, the vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Salt and Sulphur, being depreſſed or conſumed, the watery and earthy particles predominate, the blood ought not to be ſent out, but preſerved even as the treaſure of life; for when the abundance of Spirits are ſo ſmall, any loſs of them doth cauſe all the functions to ſtagger, and gives way to the diſeaſe; wherefore in a Dropſie, Cachexia, Conſumption, and other Diſtempers, where the active Principles are greatly depreſſed, the opening a vein is almoſt the ſame thing as cutting the mans throat.</p>

                           <note place="margin">In ſome caſes about Phleboto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my it is very doubtfull.</note>In the before-mentioned caſes, where the temperament of blood is reſpected, it is eaſie to determine, whether Phlebotomie be convenient or not; but in ſome others, as in a putrid continual feaver, when upon this hinge Life and Death are turned, there is need of the greateſt deliberation: and ſo much the rather becauſe the event of the Diſeaſe, and the ſucceſs of all the accidents in its whole courſe, whether good or bad, is uſually imputed to Blood-letting, or its omiſſion: and from hence it is, that Phyſitians being ſolicitous to preſerve their own repute, do chiefly raiſe doubts in their conſultations of this matter.<note place="margin">And chiefly in a continual pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid Feaver.</note> But truly in this difficult knot that we may not be led by the rumour of the vulgar (as it chances to happen) one while approving, another while condemning Phlebotomie, but with more certain advice: we muſt conſider the ſtate of the Blood, the tendency of the morbific matter, and the ſtrength of Nature. Firſt as to the former, if in a putrid Feaver, the blood very much growing hot ſhall raiſe a great heat, with thirſt, watchings, and burning of the Jaws, and no eruption of abundant ſweat, nor puſhes appear, or is ſuddenly expected, opening of a vein is ſo clearly demonſtrated,<note place="margin">How the doubt is to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</note> that it is a wickedneſs to omit it; but on the contrary if in a languid body, a ſlow and remiſs Feaver, but continual, ariſes, with a weak Pulſe, let Blood letting be ſpared, and the cleanſing thereof be procured by breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sweats, Urine, and bliſtering. Notwithſtanding, in a middle ſtate of Blood, and of a Feaver, Phlebotomy almoſt indifferent in it ſelf, is determined by other things. Therefore ſecondly we muſt weigh the tendency or flux of the morbific matter, which if it remain dull in the maſs of blood, and unfit to be ſeparated, and ſo (as it is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently wont to be) inſtead of a Criſis, a tranſlation towards the head be made, and threaten the brain and nervous ſtock, the cutting of a vein ought ſeaſonably to be adminiſtred, whereby theſe evils may be provided againſt. Notwithſtanding, if that this matter being ſoon raiſed into a rage, and either ruſhing inwardly to the bowels of the nether Belly, provokes a huge Vomiting, or Dyſenterical affections, or being driven outwardly, ſeems to be about to bring the Small upon, Meaſles, and other puſhes, every ſuch force of Nature, if good, ought not to be diſturbed, if evil, not to be made worſe by Phlebotomie; for in theſe caſes it is not only dangerous to let blood, but alſo very ſcandalous. Thirdly, about Phlebotomy to be adminiſtred in a doubtful caſe, we are to take heed to the ſtrength of the Patient; for in a health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Conſtitution, a vigorous Age, the commencing of a Diſeaſe, and the functions both vital and animal being yet in a florid or indifferent eſtate, we may confidently preſcribe letting of blood, unleſs ſomething indicates the contrary. Notwithſtanding, when it is otherwiſe, as to thoſe conditions, we may not raſhly proceed to that Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation.</p>

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:40331:184"/> emptyed, the blood having obtained a more free ſpace, is circulated pleaſantly and undiſturbedly, beſides, whatever is extravaſated of the Blood or Serum, is wont to be ſuckt up again and reduced into its courſe.</p>

And firſt as to what relates to general Diſtempers, it is commonly enough known, that letting blood is indicated by a hot and dry temperament, and interdicted by a moiſt and cold. It is uſually propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in every Feaver, but never in a Dropſie. Moreover, if we conſider particular Diſeaſes, there is no region or part of the Body, but as they rejoyce in the influence of vital as well as nutritious blood (as long as it is well) ſo as often as it is diſturbed in any place, or reaches out any diſagreeable or provocative thing, in place of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign Juice, it requires avocation and a letting out thereof. If I ſhould take notice of every ſingle caſe of this Indication, we ſhould here rehearſe almoſt the whole Patho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie of the humane body. An aking Head, a Brain oppreſs'd with blood, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed with Serum (whence ſpring a world of evils) burning of the eyes, inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the face, mouth and throat, all the diſeaſes of the Breaſt and Praecordia (inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the diſorder of Blood affords a riſe or fuel to each of theſe) likewiſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions or inflammatory affections of the Liver, Spleen, and other Bowels; more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, as a Plethora, and Athletick habit of the whole body, ſo alſo the tumours of each member, painful and convulſive paſſions, ſeem to accuſe the blood as Author of all the evil, and require its ſending out, as a certain kind of revenge.</p>
                        <p>In theſe and very many other diſtempers,<note place="margin">After Phleboto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my being indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated theſe four things follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ought to be conſidered.</note> if at any time Bleeding be clearly indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, before it be performed four things ought to be conſidered, <hi>viz.</hi> In what place, by what manner and inſtrument, at what ſeaſon, and in what quantity the Blood ought to be taken away.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, as to the former, although according to the Laws of the Circulation of the Blood, as oft as the maſs ſhould be diminiſhed,<note place="margin">Firſt the place from whence Blood is to be taken.</note> it differs little from what veſſel a part thereof be taken, provided it be large enough; notwithſtanding, for that beſides a general evacuation of the blood, ſometimes a particular one properly called Deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation (as when the blood is to be brought out of a private place where it is accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated) and moreover a Revulſion, when it is to be called into this or that part, are intended; for that reaſon, in a humane Body there are appointed as it were various Boundaries, out of which, now by this, now by that, or by another vein, the blood may be emitted as occaſion is given, and for the uſes chiefly requiſite.</p>
                        <p>If therefore at any time an univerſal Evacuation of the blood be indicated, the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an vein of the Arm is beſt to be opened, for this is eaſily opened being large enough, and whereas it equally flows from the whole body to the orifice thereof being open enough, by whoſe more free efflux not only a Plethora is taken away, but the greater veſſels being every where emptyed after this manner, the blood ſtagnating in any place, is brought into motion, and being extravaſated is again ſwallowed up into the veins; wherefore, in great diſtempers when the blood being heaped in the Brain,<note place="margin">In ſome caſes from the Arm.</note> or Praecordia, does threaten ſudden deſtruction, the beſt way not only of general Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation, but of a Revulſion, is to ſend the blood by a full current out of the vein of the Arm, being largely open'd.</p>
                        <p>But if without any great Plethora the blood ought to be evacuated from the whole, and pulled back from the upper part of the body towards the inferiour, as in the ſuppreſſion of the menſtrual flux or Hemorrhoids, it will be rather fit to bleed in the Foot or ſedentary veſſels by Leeches.<note place="margin">In others from the vein of the Forehead, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples or Throat.</note> But if after the blood being evacuated from the whole, it be alſo to be derived from any private part where it is accumula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, let its drawing off be near the place affected. Hence in Cephalick Diſeaſes, we open the vein of the Forehead, of the Temples, or of the Throat. To cure Tumours, or pains raiſed in the Joynts, we cut a veſſel either beneath or near them, or draw out the blood by Cupping-glaſſes or Leeches. In like manner in diſtempers of the Thorax and nether Belly, either Cupping-glaſſes are applyed to the region ſuffering,<note place="margin">The Cephalic Vein of the Arm, the Liver Vein, or the Salvatella er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneouſly ſo called.</note> or Leeches to the ſedentary veſſels.</p>
                        <p>But that ſome Veſſels are reported to bear a peculiar reſpect to certain Bowels, and that they ought to be lanced in their diſtempers; <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch are the outward brachial vein, which is ſaid to reſpect the head, and the inward the Liver, alſo the outer vein of the Hand tending to the Ring-finger, which is ſaid to reſpect the Spleen, and for
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:40331:185"/> that cauſe this is called the Salvatella, and the former of them the Cephalick, and the other the Jecorary; all this is meerly a vulgar error, which being propt by no reaſon or Anatomical obſervation, I am ignorant whence it took its origine: Therefore as ſoon as it is agreed on to cut a vein and its place, let a large Veſſel be choſen, and very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, that it may the more eaſily be opened; and being remote from an Arterie, Nerve, and Tendon, may be the more ſecurely lanced; wherefore in the Arm the median vein is commonly choſen, although the Cephalick being leſs environed with other Veſſels, is the more ſafely opened.</p>

                           <hi>Helmont</hi> of late, and ſtill certain followers of him, Pſeudochymiſts and Fanaticks, have ejected Bleeding out of all Phyſick, becauſe they think this evacuation to be a great injury to Nature, (which being aided either by her own ſtrength, or by their Panacea's, they will have to overcome every offenſive thing of her ſelf;) Surely, this is no leſs ridiculous a thing than that long ſince <hi>Chryſippus, Apamantes, Strato,</hi> and ſome others, (as <hi>Galen</hi> reports) damn'd this remedy, becauſe a vein is diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultly known from an Artery. Truly it is manifeſt enough by ſad experience, that in cutting a vein ſometimes an Artery hath been pierced; whence either death or loſs of the member ſometimes enſues: the reaſon whereof is, not as is commonly alleadged, that the coats of an Artery being more nervous or membranous than the coats of a Vein, can ſcarcely or not at all be healed; when in truth that Veſſel is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with more and thicker fleſhy fibres;<note place="margin">Wherefore in opening a Vein the pricking of an Artery is ſo dangerous.</note> but the cauſe is, that an Artery like the Heart it ſelf, ought inceſſantly to ſhake and beat, the fibres thereof repeating perpetual turns of Syſtole and Diaſtole; wherefore, a little hole being made in its Pipe for the moſt part remains uncurable by reaſon of the continual motion of the Veſſel, and the efflux of blood. It is otherwiſe in a Vein whoſe opening is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſtopt of its own accord; for but little of contractive work lies in its Coats, yea this only, that its fibres being lightly opened as occaſion ſerves, the blood flowing back of its own accord, is gently moved forwards; and after Phlebotomy, the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel being empty, they are permitted to be quiet, ſo that in the mean time the little hole made by inciſion is eaſily glewed together. Whenever Phyſitian or Patient do dread the opening of a vein to be adminiſtred, drawing of blood by Leeches or Cupping-glaſſes, will aptly enough and with like advantage ſupply the defect hereof. Moreover theſe adminiſtrations to remove the conjunct cauſe of a diſeaſe, where there is need rather of partial than general Evacuation or Derivation, are frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preferr'd to Blood-letting it ſelf. There is no need to dwell longer on explicating the manner and reaſon of the effects of either of theſe operations, commonly enough known, but proceeding to other things, we will next throughly weigh the Time and Quantity of letting Blood.</p>
                        <pb n="141" facs="tcp:40331:185"/>
                        <p>The opportunity of letting blood is often of ſo great moment,<note place="margin">Thirdly, The Time of letting Blood comes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> that whereas this Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation ſucceeds well at one time, at another it highly prejudices: But there are diverſe reſpects of time to be conſidered about the due performance of Blood-letting, but chiefly theſe four: The Time of the Diſeaſe, the Age, the Year, and Day: The firſt concerns chiefly the Cure of the Patient, the others the Preſervation of him.</p>
                        <p>Firſt therefore if blood ought to be let in any Diſeaſe,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>1.</hi> In reſpect of the diſeaſe.</note> it will be chiefly ſeaſonable about the beginning or encreaſe thereof, but not at all or very cautiouſly in the ſtate or declination. For at that time whilſt Nature is buſied, endeavouring a Criſis, ſo that the Spirits are in great labour, and the blood ferments very much, that great endeavour of it ought not to be diſturbed; and in the height of the diſeaſe, either Nature being Conquereſs doth not want ſuch a relief, or being ſubdued will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure ſuch an Evacuation.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, If at any time for preſervation it be deliberated touching letting blood,<note place="margin">

Notwithſtanding the firſt and ſecond time it ought not to be done without great occaſion, for that being once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun and afterwards repeated, it will ſoon proceed into an inevitable Cuſtom.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, Hence they who uſed to let blood Spring and Autumn,<note place="margin">

But to whom it will be either profitable or neceſſary to breath a Vein once or twice a year, the chief ſeaſonable times will be in the beginning of Spring and Autumn, <hi>viz.</hi> when the Blood being prone to ferment anew, is in danger to change its Craſis. Phlebotomy ſeaſonably adminiſtred, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides leſt the Sulphur and Salts being exalted, it ſhould contract a feaveriſh, ſcorbuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal or other peccant diſtemper; likewiſe, leſt ſuffering a flux, it ſhould pour forth the ſerous Recrements, and other Feculencies upon the Brain, the Lungs or Bowels of the nether belly. About the Solſtices, when our bodies are very cold, or hot, the blood, as the juice of all Vegetables, conſiſting in a more fixt ſtate, and unapt to ſwell up, ought not to be let out, unleſs upon ſome urgent cauſe.</p>
                        <p>But whereas ſome preciſely, or rather ridiculouſly, obſerve about Phlebotomy,<note place="margin">The Aſpect of the Moon and Stars are here of no moment.</note> (even as the Countrey-men about Gelding Cattle,) the poſition of the Heavens, and the Aſpects of Moon and Stars, it appears altogether frivolous; and for that chiefly is this Cuſtom condemned, inaſmuch as counterfeit Aſtrologers have a Figure in their Almanacks wherein every ſign of the Zodiack, is allotted to every particular member of our bodies; and for that cauſe, under what ſign the Moon is converſant, they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid blood to be drawn from the reſpective part of man.

Moreover, this vulgar error is not only abſurd, but frequently malevolent, inaſmuch as many of the common people will abſtain from Phlebotomy whatever indication makes for the ſame, if (as they ſay) the Sign be in the place of letting blood.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, As to what relates to the time of the Day, in acute Diſeaſes,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>4.</hi> The time of the day about letting of Blood.</note> when a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian is ſent for, and there be indication for Phlebotomy immediately to be performed, after the body is prepared, he may preſcribe that operation any hour in day or night; but otherwiſe, if any interval may be allowed, then breathing a Vein rather is to be celebrated in a morning when the Stomach is faſting, the veſſels emptyed by ſweat in the night, the ſtream of blood being quieteſt, and appearing free from any ſerous filth. Yea although neceſſity urge, it may be deferr'd a little untill the new Juice of things eaten be paſs'd into the blood; for the veſſels being emptyed will not only ſnatch the crude Chyle into themſelves, but frequently what is diſagreeable or unproportionate unto the blood, whence not only its motion is diſordered, but alſo the vital flame runs the hazard of being extinct. I have known ſome by Phlebotomy adminiſtred preſently after plentiful Drinking, or pouring in of vinous liquors, to have fallen into dreadfull ſwoundings away, which have laſted very long, untill the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſpirit being almoſt overwhelmed recovered it ſelf again.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, in the fifth place, the opening the vein being indicated,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>5.</hi> The Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Blood to be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ought to be conſidered.</note> and its time appointed, there remains ſtill no little conſideration to be had, what Quantity of blood is to be let out; in which point there is moſt commonly a fault committed, while ſome being too audacious, and others no leſs timerous, they affix thoſe bounds on this or that ſide of which for the moſt part conſiſts the Right. For that I may
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:40331:186"/> omit thoſe who ſcarcely or not at all admit of Phlebotomy (as I have before hinted) ſo I cannot eaſily aſſent to their practice who fear not to draw blood to ſwounings:<note place="margin">Too much Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botomy to be avoided.</note> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, an error of no light moment is committed within the moderate bounds, while in ſome caſes blood is drawn by too ſparing a hand,<note place="margin">But a more ſpare Bleeding often hurts, and fixes a feavour.</note> and in others with too free. In a burning Feaver, Pleuriſie, Peripneumonia, Squinancy, Frenzie, Apoplexie, and other great diſeaſes, that have their origine from a turgeſcency or phlegmonic incurſion of the blood, a ſparing Phlebotomy doth always more prejudice than advantage. For beſides that it doth not remove the antecedent cauſe of the diſeaſe, to wit, the Plethora, it further cauſes the conjunct cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the inflammation and burſting out of the blood to be augmented. For truly it is a conſtant obſervation, that upon blood too ſparingly drawn, the whole maſs doth boyl up more notably, and doth acquire a new flux into the part affected; the reaſon of which is, that in a great Plethora many portions both of the Blood and Serum being thruſt forward into receſſes and ſtrait places, are there conſtrained to abide; which, after the Veſſels being a very little emptyed,<note place="margin">The Reaſon of which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</note> do impetuouſly regurgitate into the maſs of blood, and do much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb it, and force it more impetuouſly to and fro. Wherefore alſo in this reſpect the veſſels ought to be very much emptyed, <hi>viz.</hi> that beſides freeing the former Juice from ſtraitneſs, alſo ſpace may be given to the Juice reduced from exile, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe being not congruous, coming upon the blood, troubles it, and provokes it into efferveſcencies and eruptions. From hence we may obſerve, that almoſt all men grow more hot preſently after Phlebotomy, and yet the blood being ſufficiently evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, a little after they enjoy a more temperate condition.</p>
                        <p>But as a ſlender withdrawing of blood in ſome caſes is not only vain, but is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with prejudice, ſo in other caſes too much effuſion is rarely committed ſcot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>free, and ſometimes brings notable detriment of health. For when either ſtrength languiſhes, or the body labours under a notorious Cachexia, we muſt ſpare Blood-letting, and its taking away is either prohibited, or being indicated by ſome accident, is allowed but in a ſmall quantity. Wherefore in men endowed with a weak, tender and cold Conſtitution, and in conſumptive perſons, thoſe affected with a long or malignant Feaver,<note place="margin">In ſome caſes the miſſion of Blood muſt be altogether avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> alſo in Hydropicks or Cacochymicks a vein is not raſhly to be breathed, at leaſt if it be, much blood is not ſuffered to be taken away. It will be an impoſſible thing to preſcribe general Rules, according to the particular caſes of every individual perſon, whereby the quantity of letting Blood may be exactly proportion'd according to the ſtrength of the Diſeaſe and the ability of the Patient; but let this be left to the judgment of the prudent Phyſitian preſent, and let his Commands be ever exactly obſerved; And let not (as it every where is) ſuch leave he given to Quacks, Empiricks and Barbers to play with humane life, who every where raſhly and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly uſe Phlebotomy; and if the blood ſpring more freely and appear diſcolour'd, therefore bragging of the veſſel being well pierc'd, they ſay it muſt be let out more plentifully, becauſe it appears bad, when oftentimes on the contrary it ought to be ſpared.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Phlebotomy ought ever to be done with a large orifice.</note>As ſoon as the Quantity of Blood to be taken away is determined, our next care ought to be, that a more large orifice being made, the blood equally mixt may flow out as ſoon as may be; for otherwiſe, if it go out from a ſmall hole, or drop by drop, or with a little ſtream, the maſs of blood fermenting will ſeparate into parts, and what is more ſubtile and ſpirituous will burſt out, the thicker and feculent remaining behind. Hence it is to be obſerved, that the blood being let out of a large orifice with a more full ſtream, if it be a little ſtopt with the finger clapt on it, and a little after ſuffered to flow out, the blood going out the ſecond time becomes much purer and brighter than the former, becauſe in the interval of flowing, the more ſubtile par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles being unfolded from the thicker, and accumulated together, have prepared themſelves to fly away. Wherefore, if <hi>Hippocrates</hi>'s Precept ſhall be obſerved, <hi>viz.</hi> to let it run to the change of its Colour, it behoves us to procure that it ſpring out quickly, with a full and not interrupted ſtream. Beſides all this, as to what apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to the alteration of the blood let out, and cold, and to the inſpection and the judgment thereof, for that we have often diſcourſed it in other places, we now paſs it by, haſtening to other things; and now the thread of Method leads us to entreat of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies oppoſite to Blood-letting, to wit <hi>Iſchaemones,</hi> that is, thoſe which are convenient to ſtop immoderate Haemorrhagies, whether engenderd by Nature or by accident.</p>

                        <p>EVen as Art imitates Nature in letting forth the blood by Phlebotomy offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in plenty, or temperament, or in its motion,<note place="margin">Every Hemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhage is not to be ſtopt.</note> ſo it ſuccours her being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed or working wrong, by ſtopping the flux of blood whenſoever it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate or hurtfull. Whereas there are various and many ſpecies of an Hemorrhage, there is no need of Phyſick for them all. If perhaps a great effuſion of blood happens by a ſolution of unity, excited by an outward accident, as a wound, or ſtroke, Chirurgery ſuggeſts the manner of Adminiſtrations whereby it ſhould be reſtrained. Moreover, an Hemorrhage as long as it ſhall be Critical, ought to be diſturbed by no Medicine, but left to the meer government of Nature (as long as ſhe does aright uſe her power;) and as to the Symptomatic, whileſt it is little or not much troubleſome, there is required no Phyſick: notwithſtanding there is great need of it, if at any time the Flux of blood be either immoderate, or flow out by unapt places.</p>
                        <p>Eruptions of blood of this laſt kind chiefly challenge a Cure,<note place="margin">But only the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate and inconvenient.</note> if perhaps the blood be caſt upward by Coughing or Vomit, or downwards by ſeige, or thrown off through the Ureters. For in theſe caſes, though the quantity of the Blood excreted, be not much to be dreaded, notwithſtanding becauſe often a dangerous or mortal Ulcer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues the ſolution of the Unity ſo made in the Lungs, or in the Stomach, Guts, or in a Vein; therefore we muſt induſtriouſly rancounter thoſe Hemorrhagies from their firſt appearance. Therefore among the Diſeaſes of thoſe parts,<note place="margin">The chief Caſes of the latter are reckoned.</note> ſuch bloody excreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are accounted; but we have already in another place delivered the Theories of Spitting Blood, and of the affection Dyſenterical, and the reaſons of healing them, ſo that there is no need to repeat them here; neither alſo to propound here a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for bloody Urine, for that it belongs to the Nephritic Pathology; wherefore we will paſs to thoſe Paſſions, for which by reaſon of an immoderate efflux of blood, there is great need of reſtraining Medicines.</p>
                        <p>The kinds of theſe Affections are chiefly three, <hi>viz.</hi> Haemorrhage of the Noſtrils,<note place="margin">And alſo of the former.</note> of the Flowers, and the immoderate Flux of the Hemorrhoids: The Cure of which laſt doth belong more to Chirurgery than Phyſick, and I think it beſt to referre the other to the hyſterical Pathologie.<note place="margin">For the preſent the Cure of the Hemorrhage of the Noſtrils is only propounded.</note> Here properly belongs to this place the blood flowing out of the Noſtrils, being the moſt general kind of paſſions of that ſort, and common to every Age, Sex and Temperament, ſo that from the Diagnoſtick and Therapeutick of it duely aſſign'd, the uſes and efficacies of Medicines ſtopping blood will beſt appear: for what we proffer for the unfolding the Cauſes and Cure of this bloody eruption, may be accommodated unto all other dreadful Hemorrhagies.</p>
                        <p>It is obſervable enough, that the Flux of blood from the Noſtrils doth happen to moſt men from extraordinary occaſions; for as oft as the blood, about to break out through its own turgeſcency, or through laxity of the veſſels, is apt in ſome place to make or find its way, it is, by a certain inſtinct of Nature, very often directed to the Noſtrils, as to the part moſt eaſily opened.<note place="margin">A deſcription of the Veſſels from which Blood flowes.</note> The veſſels from whence it flows in that place, are ſlips of the arterial Branch going from the Carotides, after having paſs'd the Cranium, it comes to the baſis of the Cerebrum; for this proceeding near to the mammillary Proceſſes, ſends very many twigs from it ſelf every where about, of which ſome eminent ones paſſing the hole of the Sieve-like Bone with the ſmelling Nerves, are diſtributed through the glandulous membrane, inveſting the windings of the top of the Noſe. Theſe naſal Arteries departing firſt from the Trunk of the Carotides within the skull, anticipate part of the blood chiefly ſerous from the brain, and lay aſide the Serum it ſelf and other watery recrements into the glandules of the Noſtrils, as into the proper Emunctories of that Region, whence they diſtill into the cavity thereof. Wherefore, if the mouths of thoſe little Arteries do alwayes gape ſomewhat by reaſon of the ſweating out of the Serum, it is no marvel if the blood it ſelf being made more turgid, opening them a little more (which often are too looſe of themſelves) burſts forth of dores. Indeed this Emiſſary both of the Serum and of the Blood, being apt ordinarily to open, or on any decaſion,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:40331:187"/> prevents or cures great incommodities of the brain, or of the Praecordia, yea and ſometimes of the whole body.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">They are the ſame by which the Serum di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtills to the Noſtrils.</note>For in the firſt place, this way the Serum (as I ſaid) is derived from the head, and when the mouths of thoſe Veſſels are vellicated or provoked by any ſneezing Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine put into the Noſtrils, the Serum is from thence more abundantly drawn out; which yet doth not deſcend from the Brain (as is commonly thought) but is antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated by theſe naſal arteries, leſt it ſhould go to it; from which when it is more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully drained and brought forth by the uſe of Errhines, for that cauſe the Brain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes more ſerene and exempt from vapours. Then ſecondly, leſt the Brain ſhould be overwhelmed at any time by blood more impetuouſly overflowing, a portion here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of paſſing through theſe veſſels and breaking out, eaſily prevents it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">The Blood flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth in too great plenty from theſe Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, is very hurtfull.</note>But ſometimes it happens that an Haemorrhage of this kind, rather becomes a Diſeaſe than a Remedy; for whenſoever the blood flows out more often and more abundantly than is fit from the Noſtril, if life be not immediately hazarded by reaſon of too great loſs, yet the remaining maſs of the blood being impoveriſhed thereby, and loſing its temper, acquires a cachectick and frequently an hydropick diſpoſition; even as we have clearly intimated before, where we alſo have ſhewn the Aetiologie of this diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in common with other too great Hemorrhagies, either to conſiſt in the fault of the blood, or of the veſſels, or of both together.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">The cauſes of ſuch an immoderate flux.</note>Firſt, the blood bringing an Hemorrhage of it ſelf, offends either in Quantity or Quality; and therefore while occaſionally it boyls up, it cannot be contained within the veſſels, but either opening their mouths by diſtending them, or unlocking them by its acrimony,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>1.</hi> From the fault of the Blood.</note> it skips out: To which happens that the blood being ſometimes diſſolved in its conſiſtence, and as it were infected, becomes unfit to continue the courſe of Circulation, inaſmuch as portions thereof ſeparating from one another, are partly fixed in the fleſh or skin, having ſuffer'd death; and partly breaking out, ſtirre up frequently dreadful, and ſometimes mortal Haemorrhagies, as every where is diſcovered in malignant Feavers, and ſometimes in the Scurvy. Notwithſtanding the blood offending by meer Quantity or Acrimony, unleſs the fault of the Veſſels happening thereon provoke the flux thereof, or too eaſily permit it, ſeldom breaks out into a great Hemorrhage.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>2.</hi> From the fault of the Veſſels.</note>Therefore ſecondly, the veſſels bringing blood, as often as they conſpire to produce that affection, are uſually in the fault, either firſt inaſmuch as their ſmall mouths gaping, by reaſon of the fibres being too looſe and weak, do not readily enough tranſvaſate the blood out of the Arteries into the Veins; which fault happens to ſcorbutick and cachectical perſons; or ſecondly inaſmuch as by reaſon of the ſame moving fibres being affected with the Cramp and Convulſion, the blood being ſnatcht impetuouſly to and fro, and chiefly towards the Head, is conſtrained to break out to continue the thread of circulation, even as it will plainly appear in the caſe of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient which ſhall be ſhewn below.</p>
                        <p n="1">
                           <note place="margin">Prognoſticks.</note>1. As to the Prognoſticks, although an immoderate flux of Blood, in the Small-Pox, Meaſles, malignant Feavers, and in the Plague, doth ever preſage evil, and is expedient to be ſtopt; notwithſtanding it ought to be reſtrained not by meer cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or revulſory things, but to be chang'd by temperate Hydroticks into ſweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. An Haemorrhage of the Noſtrils, though not great, is more dangerous in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>checticks with a weak Pulſe, and a cold ſweat, than a plentifull Hemorrhage in men endued with a Pulſe ſtrong enough, and blood very fervent.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. They who are obnoxious to this Diſeaſe, by reaſon of a Dyſcraſie of blood and looſneſs of the veſſels, if there come upon both theſe a convulſive diſpoſition of the fibres of the little Arteries, they receive a far more difficult Cure, and frequently are reduced to extream languiſhings by reaſon of the great loſſes of blood.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. From thoſe who are feaveriſh, when much blood ſhall flow out of the Noſtrils, and does not terminate the diſeaſe, often-times in the place of a Criſis a delirous or a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poriferous affection ſucceeds. There are many other prognoſticks about a Hemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhage accurately remarkt by <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> which notwithſtanding properly belonging to the diſcourſe of a Feaver, we omit in this place; for truly, the Cure in general of this Diſtemper is here almoſt only intended.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Three primary Indications of Cure.</note>About which there will be three primary Indications, to wit, <hi>Curatory, Vital,</hi> and <hi>Preſervatory;</hi> the two former reſpect immediately the ſymptom to be ſtopt, as often as it ſhall be urgent; and the laſt is buſie about removing the Cauſe of the Diſeaſe,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:40331:187"/> that ſo the aſſaults of the Hemorrhage may be ſmall, or not at all. Beſides, an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhage ought to be handled one way without a Feaver, and after a different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner if preſſed with a Feaver.</p>
                        <p>Therefore whenſoever without a feaver much blood ſhall flow out of the Noſe,<note place="margin">The Curatory In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts three in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently as there ſhall be need of ſtopping Remedies, there will be three chief intentions of Curing, all being together aſſumed into practice, <hi>viz.</hi> Let the turgeſcency of blood be bridled, that it may be leſs diſpoſed into inordinate tendencies. Moreover in like manner let it be endeavoured, that as well its fluxion being withdrawn from the Noſtrils may be diverted to another place, as that the mouths of the Veſſels gaping within the Noſtrils be ſhut: for which purpoſe Remedies as well external as internal very many and of diverſe kinds are wont to be exhibited; of the former we will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat in order briefly.</p>
                        <p>Firſt therefore let the Patient be quiet, plac'd with his head upright,<note place="margin">Outward reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to ſtop the flux of blood.</note> then let many of the Joints of his Arms and Thighs, but not all, be bound with ſtrait Ligatures, which ought now and then to be looſened and removed to other parts; for all being bound together and long, by reaſon of the blood being held in the outward parts,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Ligatures.</hi>
                           </note> and too much detained from the heart, hath cauſed moſt dreadful ſwoundings; but otherwiſe this Remedy being prudently adminiſtred, frequently helps. For when the blood by this means running into the members by the Arteries, is ſtopt, that it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently returns not by the veins, its more impetuous ſpreading it ſelf into the head is impeded. Moreover, by the painfull Ligatures of the Joints, the muſcular Fibres of the Carotides Arteries are preſerved from Cramps which oftentimes come upon them.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, For diverting the tendency of blood from the Noſtrils,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Bleeding.</hi>
                           </note> it is ſometimes expedient to breath a Vein in the Arm or in the Foot. For by how much more blood is carryed by the Arteries to the vein cut, by ſo much leſs will the afflux be towards the Noſtrils. Yet this adminiſtration does not always ſo help, but ſometimes a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary effect thereof happens, as we have already obſerved in ſpitting blood. The reaſon whereof is, that the veſſels being ſuddenly and not ſufficiently emptyed, ſuck up again the diſagreeable humours formerly ejected, and ſtagnating within the pores, whereby the blood incontinently is ſtirred up into a greater eruptive tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſcency.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, Cold things applyed to the Forehead and Temples,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>3.</hi> Application of cold things.</note> alſo to the Nape of the Neck, where the vertebral Arteries aſcend, cauſe the veſſels to be bound toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the flux of blood to be ſomewhat ſtopt or repelled. Notwithſtanding it is ill which ſome adviſe, that cooling Topicks be applyed to the Jugular Veins; for ſo the blood being retarded in its recourſe, flows the more plentifully out of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils. Moreover, what is uſual, to apply linty Cloaths, or a Spunge moiſtened with Vinegar, to the Pubes and Teſticles, helps by no other means than the ligature of the members, to wit, inaſmuch as the flowing back of the venous Blood is impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. A ſudden and unexpected ſprinkling of cold water on the face, frequently ſtops an Haemorrhage, inaſmuch as it gives an impreſſion of terror.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, Cupping-glaſſes applyed upon the Hypochondres, Flanches,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>4.</hi> Cupping-glaſſes.</note> inner part of the Thighs, and the ſoles of the feet, are accounted a famous remedy as well with the ancient, as with modern Phyſitians, for diverting a tendency of the blood from the Noſtrils. And the reaſon is plain, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe a Cupping-glaſs being put on, the impulſe of air being prohibited by the ſpace of the orifice, and encreaſed every where about, preſently the blood and humours, yea and vapours, and ſolid parts, being call'd from any other tendency, are driven towards the empty ſpace of the Glaſs.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5. <hi>Frictions.</hi>
                           </note> Rubbing of the extream parts are commended in this diſtemper by ſome Practitioners, which we judge not always uſeful, nay ſcarce ſafe; becauſe, although they ſolicit a greater appulſe of the blood to the feet or hands, yet they ſo haſten the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn thereof, that the whole maſs of blood being raiſed into an efferveſcence, it ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards a more violent tendency towards the Noſtrils.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, <hi>Zacutus Luſitanus</hi> among his revulſory Remedies,<note place="margin">6. <hi>Cauteries.</hi>
                           </note> propounds an actual Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery to be applyed to the ſole of either foot; and <hi>Crato</hi> the bending the little finger of the ſame ſide, which becauſe done with no trouble we may try; but we adviſe not ſo of the former, unleſs the way of helping were more certain, which might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſate the pain and lameneſs that would enſue thereon.</p>
                        <p>Seventhly, Swounding raiſed by any means, preſently ſtops an Haemorrhage,<note place="margin">7. <hi>Faintings.</hi>
                           </note> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:40331:188"/> contumacious it be; wherefore when ſuch bleeding perſons are taken out of their beds, or when they do timorouſly admit of Phlebotomie, though but ſparingly, or have their members bound for a longer time, or are ſuddenly affrighted with ſome feigned rumour, or by ſome other occaſion fall into a ſwouning or fainting of the ſpirits, the flux of blood ceaſes thereon preſently. The reaſon whereof is evident enough, for that as ſoon as the motion of the heart fails, preſently the blood and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits ruſh thither, and ſo every outward flux is ſtopt on a ſudden, and what was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate before, doth not again return.</p>

                           </note>Tenthly, Since water caſt into the Noſtrils, doth not adhere enough to the mouths of the Veſſels, but is waſhed away by the breaking out of the blood, before it can exert its Virtue, it is therefore more expedient either that a Styptick powder be blown in, or that a Pledget dipt in the water of Vitriol, either by it ſelf, or ſtrewed with an aſtringent powder, be thruſt into the upper part of the Noſtril. For this purpoſe many and ſeveral kinds of ſtyptick powders have been preſcribed, I have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently uſed either <hi>Crocus Martis</hi> calcin'd to the higheſt redneſs, or the powder of Camphorated Vitriol, or the vitriolic Soot ſcrap't from the bottom of an old Braſs Pot, the powder whereof I have often uſed with ſucceſs in this caſe. In obſtinate He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhagies not yielding to other remedies, let Pledgets, whoſe tops are dipt in Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Colcothar, be put up deep into the Noſtrils, that the mouths of the Veſſels
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:40331:188"/> being burnt, and covered with an Eſchar, all flux of blood may be preſently ſtopt.

The moſs of a humane Skull unburied, put into the Noſtrils, is commended by many for this effect: but theſe latter applications ought to be referred to the ſympathetick Aetiologie, if they avail any thing.</p>

The ſecond Indication Vital only preſcribes a ſlender Diet, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Cordials,<note place="margin">The Poſition of the Sick.</note> and a fit handling of the Patient. The Proviſion of the firſt is ſo ſmall and eaſie, that there ſeems no need to appoint a Meaſure and Rules for it par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly. About the latter the chief queſtion is, whether we ought to retain them within or out of their beds. Without doubt the languiſhing, and thoſe obnoxious to often ſwounings, are not to be rouſed up, unleſs (as we have already hinted) it be for a Curatory attempt: as to others leſs weak, it ſeems ſo to be determined. Thoſe whoſe Blood does not eaſily tranſpire by reaſon of the conſtipation of the pores,<note place="margin">Sometimes in bed, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times out.</note> and is incited into a greater turgeſcence from the heat of the bed, and proner to break out, it will be expedient they not only remain out of bed while bleeding, but alſo ſometimes through extern applications to be cooled in the whole habit of their body, or at leaſt in moſt of their members. Wherefore, <hi>Fabritius Hildanus</hi> relates he ſuddenly cured one of a great Hemorrhage of the Noſtrils, after many things tryed in vain, by putting him into a veſſel of cold water. Alſo with like ſucceſs <hi>Riverius</hi> cured another affected in like manner, being taken out of his bed, and laid on a woollen Matte on the Pavement, he bathed his whole body with Linnen dipt in Oxycrate. Yet this method is not alike convenient for all perſons, or at all ſeaſons; but on the contrary, thoſe whoſe blood is halituous, and enjoying more open pores, doth evaporate eaſily, and being wont to be diſſolved by a more moderate heat encompaſſing them, into ſweat, and from thence find themſelves more quiet, it is more convenient that they remain within the bed, not only while the blood breaks out, but as long as there is danger of its return. For this reaſon it is, that many obnoxious to dreadful Hemorrhagies, during the Summer, when they tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire more freely, live exempt from that diſeaſe, but the Winter cold preſſing them, by reaſon of their pores being bound up, they ſuffer under more frequent and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Invaſions.</p>

                        <p>I was lately conſulted at a diſtance for a certain Gentleman that had ſuffered fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and great eruptions of blood, one while at the Noſtrils,<note place="margin">An Example of a rare Hemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhage.</note> another while at the Hemorrhoid Veſſels. He had frequently uſed Phlebotomy by perſwaſion of his friends, without benefit; yea frequently falling into cold Sweats and Swounings after breathing a vein, and notwithſtanding obnoxious to eruptions of blood, he was wont to be much worſe. I preſcribed Juleps (having not yet ſeen him) and cooling Decoctions, and Anodynes, alſo the juicy expreſſions of herbs, and other things cooling the blood, but even from theſe, (as if all ſtill far enough from the ſcope) he was nothing the better. At length being ſent for into the Countrey to viſit him, I found the affection under which he ſuffered to be meerly or chiefly convulſive; for whereas he daily bled, his Pulſe was weak, the extreme parts cold, and all his Veſſels as being too much emptyed fell flat;<note place="margin">Its Aetiologie.</note> alſo the patient was affected with a continual Vertigo and trembling of heart, and by and by with a ſwouning or fear of it. Really the blood was ſo far from breaking out by reaſon of turgeſcence, that rather the ſtream thereof being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and ſmall, it ſeemed ſcarce enough to ſuſtain the current of Circulation. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the truth of the matter was, he was often ſenſible of ſomething in his body creeping one while upward, another while downward like wind, and for the moſt part the flux of blood out of his Noſtrils or Hemorrhoids, followed the tendency of that motion: hence it was eaſie to conclude, that the moving fibres of the Veſſels carrying blood, by which they are contracted, being affected with a Convulſion, did diſorderly convey the ſtream of blood however ſmall and low, to and fro, and ſo compell it into Eruptions: which alſo happen'd the eaſier, inaſmuch as the mouths of the veſſels being laxe and gaping, ſuffered the blood forc'd into them to flow out without any due reſiſtance.<note place="margin">His Cure.</note> The inſtituted method of Curing did plainly approve of this Aetiology, inaſmuch as it happily ſucceeded, leaning on this ſuppoſition; for Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letting, and the uſe of Medicines ſtopping blood being at laſt omitted, I preſcribed the uſe of the enſuing Powder, a doſe whereof he took every ſixth hour with a fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Julep.</p>

                        <p>OF loſing Blood by Phlebotomy, whenſoever it is troubleſome and injurious, and ſwells too much, and tumultuates within the veſſels; alſo of retaining it by Medicines ſtopping Blood, as often as being outragious it rages too much of its own accord and flows out, we have hitherto largely diſcourſed. There remain other certain humours, <hi>viz.</hi> Nervous and Nutritious, as alſo Serous, and other recrementitious ones which are wont to flow within the Brain and Nerves, and as well in the nervous fibres, as the fleſhy, yea and within the Pores of the skin and of the ſolid parts, which being often depraved or hindered in motion, require emiſſion, being otherwiſe about to raiſe great troubles or pains, and frequently dangerous Diſeaſes. Wherefore, that we may ſeaſonably rencounter diſtempers that are about to riſe or take their origin from thence, Phyſick hath found out certain other Emiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, mediately or immediately deriving the forecited humours out of the parts and places where they ſhall offend. And thoſe are either continual, <hi>viz.</hi> Fontinels of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe kinds, which are as it were perpetual Drains, and pour out continually the Ichor; or they are temporary, when as occaſion requires, the Scarf-skin being taken away in ſome part of the body, the extremities of the veſſels in the skin are made naked, and withall ſo provok'd, that they ſpue out in great abundance the ſerous humours of a various deſcent and diſpoſition, and ſo continue to evacuate the ſame for ſome time, one while longer, another while ſhorter. But ſuch a manner of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the ſerous humours from the outward ſuperficies of the body or any part thereof, is wont to be procured by Medicines called by the Ancients <hi>Phaenigms,</hi> or <hi>Sinapiſmus,</hi>

                              <hi>2.</hi> How they operate.</note> If it be enquired of the manner and reaſon how theſe and other Veſicatories operate: in the firſt place we ought to ſhew by what manner actual Fires, and things endued with particles proceeding from Fire, do raiſe a bliſter; then by an eaſie Analogy the force and manner of working of thoſe ſorts of remedies will be known, which are reported to be endowed with a potential fire. Wherefore we obſerve of the former, that the fiery particles not being too vehemently applyed, penetrating the Scarf-skin without diſſolution of unity, enter under the skin it ſelf,<note place="margin">Shewed by the example of Fire.</note> where the extremities of the veſſels bringing blood, of the Nerves, and of the nervous Fibres are terminated; and there do variouſly twiſt together theſe, altering them from their poſition, and pervert the ſtructure of the whole texture of the skin: inſomuch that from all the veſſels being made angry in a high degree, the watery humour being imbued with igneous particles, and therefore rejected, as well by the blood as by the nervous Juice, is ſpued out in great abundance: This Lympha, becauſe it cannot paſs through the Scarf-skin, ſeparates it from the skin, and raiſes it into a bladdery bulk, from which at length being broke of its own accord, or occaſionally, it flows out. Moreover as long as the igneous particles adhere to the skin, and the mouths of the Veſſels, being covered with an Eſchar, are not cloſed up, theſe being continually twitched by them, do continue to ſpue out the Ichor. This kind of ichorous flux will the ſooner ceaſe, if immediately upon the hurt inflicted, the fiery particles be drawn out, by the application of ſome proper Antipyretick, as Fire it ſelf, Nitre, Soap, Onions, and the like. Moreover it runs the longer, if omitting an Antipyretick, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines hindering the generation of a Cicatrice, or of the outer-skin, and unlocking the mouths of the veſſels, be worn upon the place affected.</p>
                        <p>By theſe it is eaſie to underſtand by what manner Veſicatories perform their ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, <hi>viz.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">How Cantha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides excite Bliſters and draw forth water.</note> Cantharides (as likewiſe any other of the ſame vertue) being outwardly applyed, and being heated by Effluvia's of the parts ſubjected, and ſo being provok'd to exert their power, do plentifully diſpatch ſharp and as it were fiery particles from themſelves, which penetrating the Scarf-skin without any tearing it, they are daſhed againſt the <hi>Cutis</hi> or other skin, where firſt they act upon the Spirits, and then by the affecting theſe, upon the Humours and ſolid parts. They very much provoke the Spirits, and drive them into painful Convulſions of the fibres, diſſolve the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and conſtrain them to ſeparate into parts, ſo that the watery part being very much embued with thoſe ſharp, and as it were venemous particles, is rejected every where by the other Juice; and when in the mean time the ends of the Veſſels and Fibres are either eaten by the burning, or opened by twitching, and as it were drain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that Ichor conveying the hurtful particles is plentifully ſpued out of their little mouths; which then ſeparates the impervious <hi>Cuticula</hi> or the Scarf-skin, from the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:40331:191"/> other skin or <hi>Cutis</hi> it ſelf, and raiſes it into a little bladder, and after this being broken and taken away, it is for ſome time poured out by the ulcerated skin (as we ſhewed it to come to paſs by reaſon of the particles of fire.)</p>
                        <p>But this is not only done, becauſe the ſerous Juice imbibing the ſharp parts of the Medicine, and conveying them out, doth not always bear them all back the ſame way by which they entred, but ſometimes this being endued with theſe ſtings, regurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates into the maſs of Blood; and afterwards being circulated with it, and ejected with its infeſtous burden through other Emunctories,<note place="margin">Why they bring a fervent Dyſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</note> offends ſome weak or tenderer Channels in its paſſage or going forth; from whence very many contract a Strangu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, from great or many Veſicatories, by reaſon of the urinary paſſages being affected for that cauſe with Acrimony or Eroſion, which in ſome becomes moſt ſharp and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable. Alſo that application ſometimes brings bloody Urines to others afflicted with the Stone; hence a ſuſpicion alſo ariſes, that thoſe who have tender Lungs, or who are ſubject to a Conſumption, are much endangered by this Medicine outwardly applyed; which notwithſtanding I have not known happen to any; but can rather atteſt by frequent experience on the other ſide, that it redounds to advantage ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than hurt. For the more ſharp particles of Cantharides, if they be long ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, being ſometimes imbibed more plentifully by the blood, infect its whole Serum: which Juice ſo ſharpened, as long as it is confounded with the Balſamick blood, hurts no part; but being ſeparated from it by the Kidneys, it ſometimes brings hurt to them, and frequently not only twitches the neck of the Bladder by its Acrimony, but ſometimes corroding it, cauſes filth, and little skins, nay and blood to come away: but in the maſs of blood, the ſame more ſharp, ſaline-volatile par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles do often moſt notably help; inaſmuch as they deſtroy the fixt or acid Salts in it, and unlock the conſiſtence of the blood too much bound up, and ſo do cauſe the ſerous and other morbific recrements before wrapt up with it, to be ſeparated from it, and to be more eaſily diſpatched by Urine and Sweat;<note place="margin">Veſicatories move Sweat and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine.</note> hence Veſicatories being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed long in Feavers do call forth plentifull Urine and a more eaſie Sweat. Alſo they open the obſtructed wayes, and move together the portions of Blood or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, ſtagnating or being extravaſated in any place, and reſtore them to their Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. Wherefore they are not uſed only to help in ſerous maladies, but alſo in thoſe of the blood, yea in a Pleuriſie, Peripneumonia, and in any other Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</p>
                        <p>Having hitherto ſhewed after what manner Veſicatories operate firſt on the Spirits, and then on the Humours and ſolid parts, it is now our buſineſs in the next place to ſhew both the good and evil effects of them, as alſo the manners of uſing them. But that they in the firſt place operate on the Spirits is manifeſt from hence, that they exert no power on the deceaſed, and it is an ill Omen in thoſe that are lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing, when Veſicatories have no operation, becauſe it is an Indication that the Animal Spirits are much dejected, or abundantly diminiſhed.</p>

                              <hi>1.</hi> As to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of the Skin.</note>Firſt, As to the former, the humours that are immediately ſent out by a Veſicatory, drop forth partly from the pores and glandules of the Skin, and partly out of the mouths of the little Arteries, and partly out of the extremities of the Nervous fibres; perhaps ſome little of the Juice newly received, out of the mouths of the veins, though not much, ſeems to be carryed back. The humours mediately drawn out by a Veſica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory are thoſe which the aforeſaid parts being emptyed receive elſewhere, and derive them forth.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The Skin is a thick Membrane conſiſting of a double Coat, very porous, alſo thick ſet about with moſt numerous glandules, with fat, as alſo the ends of the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and fibres being terminated therein, and thickly woven one within another. Wherefore, while a portion of it is made bare, the Scarf-skin being taken off with a Veſicatory, and the nervous fibres being twitched, do bind together, and wreath the glandules and pores, the ſerous humour contained in both, is moſt plentifully ſqueezed out. And whereas ſome pores are pervious into others, the Serum doth not only flow out of the place bliſter'd, but ſometimes into the little holes firſt ſo empty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, a portion of the Serum coming from the neighbouring pores ſucceeds, and thence by and by ſweats out: wherefore in Patients affected with an Anaſarca, the little
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:40331:191"/> ulcers raiſed by a Veſicatory, exhauſt the waters every where in great plenty, and draw them out of the neighbourhood, yea and ſometimes at a great diſtance.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The little mouths of the Arteries being uncovered and twitched about the bliſtered place, do not only vomit out a portion of the Serum brought to them,<note place="margin">

                        <p n="3">3. Both reaſon and experience have enough proved,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>3.</hi> In reſpect of the Nerves and of the humours abounding in them and in the nervous parts.</note> that Veſicatories evacuate a certain humour from the Nerves and nervous Fibres, and for that cauſe profit very much in convulſive diſtempers: For ſurely we have in another place clearly enough demonſtrated, that the watery liquor of the Brain and Nervous ſyſtem, doth ſometimes abound with heterogeneous Particles. Alſo it is manifeſt by frequent and familiar obſervation, that the impurities and recrements of that liquor, together with the watery Juice, do ſpontaneouſly ſweat out from the Nerves and nervous Fibres, when the fluor is raiſed, and either reſtagnating within the maſs of blood, are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed off by Urine or by Sweats, or being depoſited within the Cavities of the bowels, are diſpatched by Vomit or Stool. Wherefore, when a Veſicatory is applyed, the extremities of the Nerves and nervous Fibres being made bare, and very much angred, immediately a humour abounding near their ends is voided; and alſo the whole Juice planted within their paſſages by a long ſucceſſion, is chafed, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from ſtagnation; and the heterogeneous particles mixt with that nervous Juice, being every where agitated and derived from the Brain, ſlide towards their newly opened Emiſſary, by degrees, and at length are removed wholly forth.</p>
                        <p>From theſe things we may collect,<note place="margin">For the curing of what Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Veſicatories are convenient.</note> for the Cure of what Diſeaſes this kind of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy doth chiefly conduce; for by reaſon of its evacuation out of the pores and glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules of the skin, as often as any ſerous, ſalt, ſharp, or otherwiſe hurtful humour is collected in thoſe parts, or their neighbourhood, and being excluded from the Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of blood, ſhall obſtinately ſtick in that place, ſurely there is no more ready or eaſie way afforded for drawing it forth, than by applying a Veſicatory,<note place="margin">

Wherefore, it is not only indicated by an Anaſarca, or by any foulneſs or eruptions of the Skin, but moreover a Veſicatory is required for pains either arthritical or ſcorbutical, fixt any where in the extern habit of the body, or in any certain member.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, In reſpect of the Blood,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>2.</hi> They take away the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities and ill temperament of the blood.</note> Veſicatories are always uſed in malignant Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, as well to purge out leiſurely any heterogeneous or morbific matter, as to change it from a diſpoſition either too acid, or ſalt, or otherwiſe peccant, into a right tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament; yea they are of moſt excellent uſe in all putrid feavers of ill habit and hard to be judged of. Alſo for that cauſe in the Scurvy, Leucophlegmatia, <hi>Pica Virginum</hi> or Green Sickneſs, alſo in any other ill habit of body,<note place="margin">This Remedy is profitable in thoſe Diſeaſes which the blood produces in other parts.</note> this kind of remedy affords frequently notable help. Moreover not only for the ſake of correcting the blood it ſelf, but beſides as often as it being depraved ſpreads its corruption on other parts, and ſo doth firſt beget diſeaſes in the Head, the Cheſt, the nether Belly, or Members, and then excites their Fits, Veſicatories are uſually exhibited with ſucceſs. Wherefore it is a common remedy in Head-aches, a Vertigo, and ſoporiferous affections, no leſs than in a Catarrh or any defluxion either into the Eyes, Noſe, Palate, or Lungs, in which every one without conſulting a Phyſician, will preſcribe to themſelves Cantharides for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion. I confeſs, when I have often been ſurprized with a great Cough, with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant and thick Spittle (whereto I am originally obnoxious) I have received relief from no other Remedies more than from Veſicatories; wherefore I am wont, while

And alſo pains that are fixt and moſt fiercely tormenting in the membranous parts, are ſeldom cured without this adminiſtration. For ſometimes morbific humours and Particles which being deeply radicated, yield nothing at all to Purgers or ſweating Medicines or Diureticks, yet have ſeemed to have been pulled up by the roots by Veſicatories, as it were remedies laying violent hands on the diſeaſe.</p>

But ſecondly this remedy with ſome doth neither well agree, nor operate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably; becauſe it rubifies the place very much to which it is applyed, or rather ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coriates it with moſt fierce pain and great inflammation; notwithſtanding the little ulcers made in the ſame place, although they do for ſome time torment the patient, yet pour out very ſmall or ſcarce any Ichor: Alſo to theſe always bliſter'd with tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for the moſt part a violent Strangury happens.

This I have known ſo conſtantly happen to ſome Patients, that afterwards I was fain to reſtrain their uſe of Cantharides although there was need of them; the reaſon whereof ſeems to be, that the blood being endowed with a ſalt Serum, and more ſharp than it ought to be, hath a conſiſtence too eaſily diſſolved: wherefore, that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous juice being ſharp, and fretting of it ſelf, as ſoon as it is provok'd by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Medicine looſening the conſiſtence of the Blood too eaſily diſſolved, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately breaking out with violence from the maſs of blood, whereſoever there is a paſſage afforded, it flows out with a full torrent through the mouths of the veſſels gaping in the bliſtered place.

In ſuch a Caſe after the little Ulcers for the firſt days have poured out little or a very ſmall quantity of Ichor, at length Nature attempting a Criſis by this way, a vaſt Illuvies of Serum flows out from the ſame; and ſo ſometimes for many dayes, nay weeks, continues to flow out, untill the Patient before accounted deſperate, recovers his entire Health. Little Ulcers ſo abundantly flowing, as it is not eaſie,<note place="margin">They are not to be cured.</note> ſo it is not ſafe to ſtop them before the whole Mine of the Diſeaſe be conſumed.

Thoſe ſluces were ſcarce two days ſtopt, but his diſeaſe revived, and on the ſudden he was affected with fainting of Spirits, and often ſwooning, a cold Sweat, and a low weak Pulſe: and whereas he could not be relieved by any Remedies, however cordial they were, he dyed within three days; the cauſe of which ſeems to be, that the malignant matter being ſuddenly repercuſſed, fell into the Cardiac Nerves, whoſe action being hindred, the vital function quickly failed.</p>

                           <hi>SECT. III. CHAP. IV.</hi> Of Fontinels, or Iſſues.</head>
                        <p>BEſides Veſicatories, which being as it were the extemporary Emiſſaries of the Serum, and other humours externally to be brought forth, are only raiſed upon ſome occaſions, and then after their efficacy a little ſhewed, are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to be dryed up; there are others eſteemed as it were continual Fountains,<note place="margin">Iſſues rather a preſervatory than curatory Remedy.</note> therefore named <hi>Fonticuli</hi> or Iſſues, out of which the Ichor or ſerous humour flows with a conſtant Spring. Thoſe former, as they are requiſite for the moſt part for Cure-ſake in acute or other Diſeaſes, whoſe morbifick matter requires a quick diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch, in the firſt place reſpect the conjunct cauſe of the Diſeaſe to be removed; and therefore being more broad, are made only ſuperficial, that ſuch little Ulcers being large, may evacuate much, and then eaſily be healed: but on the other ſide, Iſſues being chiefly indicated for preſervation, are ordained to remove or vanquiſh the procatarctick cauſe of the Diſeaſe: wherefore they conſiſt of a more narrow orifice, but made more deep through the thickneſs of the whole skin, to the end, that while they ſend out the morbifick matter in leſſer quantity, they may derive it further, and continue longer to purge it out.</p>
                        <p>There are three chief heads of diſquiſitions concerning Iſſues, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt,<note place="margin">About theſe, three things are to be enquired into.</note> what humours theſe Emiſſaries chiefly evacuate, and whence they bring them: Secondly, in what Diſeaſes or Conſtitutions they better or worſe agree: Afterwards Thirdly in what places, in what form, and with what inſtruments they ought to be made.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. As to the former, Iſſues, like Bliſters,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>1.</hi> What hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours they eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate.</note> purge out all humours fixt within the skin, (although in a leſs compaſs,) or brought through it as well by the ſanguife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, as nervous Veſſels, not only as they provoke, or as it were ſuck the outer ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies of the skin, but by piercing through the whole hide or skin, they convey
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:40331:193"/> out whatſoever flows from the ſides of the orifice through the broken Veſſels, alſo whatſoever ſlides down elſewhere beneath the orifice. Wherefore not only humours accumulated within the pores of the skin, or glandules, or brought thither by the Arteries, or Nerves, have conflux to Iſſues; but moreover the ſerous recrements un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the skin, that are wont to be tranferr'd, or creep between the interſpaces of the muſcles and membranes from place to place, tend every where unto them and find paſſage. Moreover an Iſſue appointed in the way anticipates morbifick humours, which were formerly wont to be conveyed to other weak and long afflicted parts, and by ſuch means exempts one while this part, another while that, from their inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Hence either a Gouty, or Nephritick, or Colick matter, and ſometimes a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralytical, or otherways ſcorbutical, are frequently intercepted by Fontinels, in their paſſage from their Source to their neſts or places of reſidence, and ſo are conveyed forth, and the uſual aſſaults of a diſeaſe declined: Neither doth this Emiſſary leſs purge from thence by degrees the humours impacted in any part or region of the body, and there cauſing prejudice, than water-furrows made for derivation of moiſture, and ſo prevent or cure a ſickly diſpoſition.</p>

                              <hi>2.</hi> In what diſeaſes they chiefly prevail.</note>2. From theſe ſeveral accounts of aſſiſtance, whereby Iſſues in general are wont to help, it is eaſily collected, for what diſtempers they are chiefly required; for although there is ſcarce any diſeaſe happens, wherein this remedy is either hurtfull or unprofitable, notwithſtanding it ſeems rather more neceſſary in ſome caſes than in others. It is commonly preſcribed for almoſt every diſeaſe of the head, whether outward or inward: Every one of the ordinary people procures an Iſſue as equal to all other Remedies, for the Convulſions of Infants, or Youths, for Sore-Eyes, Kings-Evil, as alſo for Head-ache in perſons adult or ancient, for drouſie, vertiginous or Cramp like diſtempers. Neither is it leſs celebrated againſt diſeaſes of the Breaſt; As who is obnoxious to a Cough, bloody or conſumptive Spitting, or an Aſthma that long enjoys his skin whole? In like manner Iſſues are commended in affects of the lower Belly; ſcarce any Hypochondriacal perſon or Hyſterical woman, in like manner no Gouty or Cachectical perſon, but hath his skin pierc'd in many places like a Lamprey. It would be a vaſt work to recount here particularly all the Diſtempers for which Fontinels are helpfull.</p>

But really this remedy, however advantagious and benign of it ſelf, doth not agree with all perſons, nor is it indifferently to be preſcribed to every one. For there are two ſorts of men, which though ſick, are to be excuſed from Iſſues, inaſmuch as this Emiſſary evacuates too much in ſome, and too little in others, or leſs than is convenient; and in the mean while remains very painful and intolerable.</p>

                              <hi>Viz.</hi> Firſt where they eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate too much.</note>Sometimes a Fontinel is not convenient, becauſe it too much evacuates or conſumes the humour or Spirits. For I have obſerved in ſome, that an Iſſue made in any part of the body, pours out an immoderate quantity of Ichor, and peccant in quality: for out of it by often turns, if not continually, a watery, thin and fetid Juice, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times diſcolouring the Pea and Coverings with blackneſs, flows out in great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, and ſo the ſtrength and fleſh is impaired by too great an Efflux there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Why they often pour out the humour too much.</note>The reaſon whereof ſeems to be this, that in ſome perſons endued with an ill diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of blood and humours, a wound being made and hindred from healing up, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generates ſtraightways into a filthy and malignant Ulcer; the ſides whereof put on the nature of an acid corruptive ferment, whereby the portions of blood continually forced thither, are ſo tainted and diſſolved, that the Serum thereof imbued with the diſſolved Sulphur, and other Corruptions, being refuſed by the Veins, flows out there copiouſly. Moreover, this putrifying pollution of an Iſſue being communicated to the blood, depraves in ſome part the whole maſs thereof, and ſo at leaſt (as alſo by too much loſs of the ſerous Juice) it is rendered leſs nutritious: Beſides, from the Sulphur of the blood diſſolved near the ſides of the Iſſue and flowing out with the Serum, the ſtreaming Ichor doth ſo ſtink, and black the Covering. Sometimes an Iſſue pouring out the Ichor not immoderately, conſumes the ſpirits and ſtrength more than it ought, which really we take cogniſance of from the effect, and ſometimes not till afterwards;<note place="margin">Why they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits too much.</note> inaſmuch as ſome, while they bear about them one or more Iſſues, remain feeble and lean; but they being ſtopt preſently become vigorous and more plump. Moreover, it is a common obſervation, that many from an Iſſue raiſed near the head, have been preſently ſurprized with a certain defect, and weakneſs of ſight, inſomuch that they have been conſtrained immediately to heal it up: which ſeems to
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:40331:193"/> happen for this cauſe, for that where the proviſion of ſpirits is ſmall, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence very thin, the ſmall loſſes of them, or of the Juice from whence they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created, if ſo be they are conſtant, are difficultly endured.</p>
                        <p>But in another and different reſpect, Iſſues like Veſicatories are forbid to ſome,<note place="margin">Iſſues are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient when they evacuate leſs than they ſhould doe.</note> or very cautiouſly preſcribed, for when they evacuate little or nothing at all, they very much vex the place, where they are made. For in perſons endued with a cholerick, or hotter conſtitution, the maſſe of blood being thicker than it ought to be, and leſs diluted with Serum, becomes more bound in its conſiſtence; in theſe the ſolution of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuity being made and kept by reaſon of the Iſſue, the blood it ſelf (for that it doth not ſufficiently diſcharge its Serum, whereby it may go away) ſticks in the paſſage, and ſo being extravaſated, cauſes a very painfull inflammation; and in the mean while, as it pours out little ichor, it remains as well unuſefull as troubleſome. The opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and uſes of Fontinels and their indications being deſigned, we ſhall ſhew in what place, in what form, and with what inſtruments they ought to be made, and after what ſort to be managed.</p>
                        <p>The places are appointed according to the ends or intentions of Curing by them,<note place="margin">The places of Iſſues are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the ends are Evacuation General, or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion, or both that and deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</note> which chiefly are theſe three, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. A general Evacuation of humours from the whole body. 2. An Evacuation and alſo a revulſion from ſome particular member. 3. An Evacuation and alſo a derivation from ſome particular member. In reſpect of the firſt it is expedient that an Iſſue be made in the left arm; The ſecond Intention requires it far from the part affected, and the Third near the part.</p>
                        <p>For theſe ends, <hi>viz.</hi> one while for this, another while that or the other Fontinels are made in all parts of the Body, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Head, Breaſt, Abdomen, in the Arms and Thighs, and in moſt parts of each of theſe, either by Inciſion, or Cautery, or piercing through, and in their holes or orifices Peaſe, or wooden Peaſe, Pellets or Pledgets, are put to keep them open. We will obſerve the principal places and kinds of Iſſues by running through the members of our body.</p>
                        <p n="1">1.<note place="margin">
                              <hi>1.</hi> In the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronal Suture.</note> A Fontinel is preſcribed by ſome to be burnt by a Cautery in the Coronal Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and is commended for exhauſting and evacuating humours out of the brain and its outer Coverings. Although ſome uſe this in familiar practice, yet I have found by experience in ſome it doth leſs happily ſucceed, inſomuch that I have or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered many Iſſues to be ſtopt that have been made on the top of the head, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed herein from Reaſon and Experience; for that the blood transferres more fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culency towards the place where it was wont to lay aſide its recrements, and depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites them in the whole vicinage, and chiefly in the part affected, (as being the weaker and more ſuſceptible part) whence a Diſeaſe is oftner augmented than cured. For the ſame reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> for the derivation of the humours from the inner head out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, ſome form Iſſues in the fore-part of the Head over the ſagittal Suture, others in the hinder part of the Head about the beginning of the Lamboides, but the ſame excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on remains againſt both as the former.<note place="margin">Iſſues in the fore and hinder part of the head.</note> And doubtleſs more rightly doth an Iſſue in the Arm anticipate the morbiſick matter that is wont to be depoſited about the head, or makes revulſion in the Thigh, and raiſed a little beneath the head, derives from thence. For this reaſon in painfull diſtempers of the brain, and Meninges, we cut a deep hole in the Nape of the Neck in Children and Youths; but for thoſe grown up, and Old men, we apply Cauteries on either ſide the Spine between the Shoulders or the Homoplatas,<note place="margin">Between the Shoulders.</note> and in the ſame places we make inciſion for two Fontinels capable of many Peaſe, often with very great ſucceſs. As to holes cut or burnt behind the Ears, or a Seton with a skane of Silk drawn through the Lobes thereof, I have ſeen them rarely with any ſucceſs, but often very troubleſome; Inaſmuch as a ſolution of Unity made in theſe places, neither diſcharges much Ichor, nor for any long ſpace; for though the hole or orifice be fill'd with a Peaſe, or Pill, it will be covered in ſpite of all endeavours to the contrary by the Cuticula, or skin growing under.</p>
                        <p>Iſſues in the back do notably help diſeaſes not only of the Head by Evacuation,<note place="margin">Which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable in many diſeaſes.</note> and derivation of the morbific matter, but alſo in all Gouts, Stone and Colicks, by anticipating the fuel of the Diſeaſe, and by intercepting it while it tends to its ſeats: which really is plainly proved by experiments and obſervations taken from the help of the Patients.</p>
                        <p>Fontinels between the Shoulders, alſo in the Arm or Thigh, conduce to the eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuating or apticipating, in pectoral Diſeaſes, the humours flowing to the Lungs, and to the drawing back thoſe depoſited there. How an Iſſue cut in the Cheſt between the Ribs doth ſometimes more immediately derive the conſumptive matter from the Lungs, we have elſewhere ſhewed.</p>

                           <note place="margin">An Iſſue in the left Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drion.</note>The Region of the Abdomen ſeems unapt for bearing an Iſſue in any part thereof; notwithſtanding the practice of ſome, although it be more rare, is much fam'd for a large Iſſue capable of many Peaſe to be burnt with a Cautery upon the Region of the Spleen for any hypochondriac affection. I have known it of ſmall benefit to ſome, at leaſt not recompenſing the trouble and pain of ſuch a remedy.</p>

                           <note place="margin">In the Groin.</note>Some time ſince I ſucceſſefully cured a weakneſs in the Loyns obſtinate to all other remedies, by a Fontinel in the Groin, and in another patient an inveterate Sciatica. For ſurely the glandulous Emunctories ſettled in that place, do imbibe very many recrements of the blood and nervous Juice; which if they be throughly and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually diſcharg'd from them by a fit vent, it will much conduce to exempt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous parts from any morbifick Mine.</p>

                           <note place="margin">In the Thigh.</note>The Thigh being a member ſoft and large in bulk, ſeems apt enough for enduring many and great Iſſues, to wit, thoſe which may purge away plentiful humours from the whole body. Yet it doth not ſucceed ſo with many patients, partly becauſe of its figure too much declining, like a Cone invers'd, the Ligature containing the Peaſe in the orifice is not eaſily kept on, and partly becauſe a ſolution of the Unity being made among the concourſe of ſo many Tendons, it frequently becomes inflamed and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; inſomuch that ſometimes it hath been neceſſary that it ſhould immediately be ſtopt up, to withdraw the trouble of pain and of lameneſs. Notwithſtanding it ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds better in ſome Patients, for that an inflammation doth not always enſue upon the place where the inciſion was made, and that the Ligature has remained immov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to thoſe that tye their hoſe above the knee.</p>

                           <note place="margin">A fit place in the member to be choſen that it may be made far from Veſſels and Tendons.</note>Moreover, as concerning Iſſues, it is requiſite to chooſe a convenient place not only in the body, but alſo in the very member where inciſion is made, which chiefly calls for the judgement of an expert Phyſician or Chirurgeon; for carefull proviſion muſt be made, leſt a Cautery or inciſion be made upon, or too near the Tendons or greater Veſſels; but let the Fontinel be made not in the very body of the muſcle, but in the interſpace or diſtance between the muſcles; where the orifice, as <hi>John Heurnius</hi> learnedly obſerves, ought to paſs through the whole skin ſo far, untill the little mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane of the muſcle underneath be penetrated. Wherefore, this part of Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery is not raſhly to be allowed to Quacks and others ignorant of Anatomy, for that from this being ill done, not only a fruſtration of the benefit, but from thence fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently great miſchief happens, and ſometimes to the hazard of life.</p>

                        <p>Whereas many and ſeveral diſtempers happen to Iſſues, help is not required for them all, but only for ſuch as are of greateſt moment: Wherefore there will be need of help, 1.

As to leſſer faults, as when the Ulcer ſhall break forth into frequent Haemorrhagies, or change its place creeping into another leſs convenient, with many other ways by which it prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, it will not be worth our labour to diſcourſe here.</p>

An inflammation frequently happens to an iſſue, and that ſo painfull ſometimes, that it threatens a Sphacela, yea and ſometimes cauſes one.

For the blood being brought thither by the Arteries, the ends of the Veſſels being cut off and obſtructed, it can neither go out nor be returned immediately by the Veins, but ſticking there in the paſſage it is accumulated more and more, and being at length extravaſated, and filling and ſtopping all the pores of the contiguous skin and

                        <p>But that it may be reduced, theſe two things will be neceſſarily requiſite: Firſt,<note place="margin">The ordinary and beſt of theſe is, that the extravaſated blood may be reduced.</note> That it be much diluted with the Serum flowing thither abundantly, or rather thruſt forward into the part: Then ſecondly, that the Veſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

But if (as in more hot tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raments it comes often to paſs) the blood being extravaſated and impacted in the pores, be not diluted by the Serum brought to it in great plenty, it will not only ſtick there pertinaciouſly, but it will irritate a fiercer Phlogoſie with a Feaver, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times other dreadful ſymptomes. So, not long agoe, when a renowned Divine, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with a thicker and hot blood, had an Iſſue cut in the inſide of his Leg, although the skin only was cut, an inflammation followed preſently, which within a few days ſo cruelly encreaſed, that it could hardly be impeded by any Remedies from dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating into a Gangrene. Wherefore, when the blood being extravaſated through the ſolution of the Union, and wanting the afflux of the Serum whereby it may be diluted and brought back, proceeds into an Inflammation,<note place="margin">What Remedies there is need of.</note> Fomentations and Cataplaſms of Emollients being outwardly adminiſtred, do often-times bring help; inaſmuch as the moiſt and ſoft particles falling from theſe, go under the blood ſtagnating, and dilute it, and ſo pleaſingly moving it together, cauſe it to return the more eaſily into the Veſſels; hence it is, that the moiſt applications of this kind being adminiſtred out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, do ſupply the defect of the intern Serum requiſite to dilute the blood;<note place="margin">For this end oftentimes purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that the blood being ſo diluted and irritated into motion, might be rendered fit for its Circulation, there is alſo need that the Veſſels which ſhould receive it ſhould be enough emptyed, for which purpoſe Phlebotomy and Purgation are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of neceſſary uſe, beſides a ſlender Diet. And indeed according to uſual cuſtom, we purge Cacochymicks or Plethoricks a little before, or after the Iſſue is made, and frequently breathe a vein in thoſe Patients. Neither are theſe Remedies only fit in an Iſſue new made, to provide againſt or diſcharge an Inflammation, but alſo they are advantageous as often as that diſtemper enſues upon an old Orifice of the skin. For as often as the blood being very impure, and together growing feaveriſhly hot,<note place="margin">An Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſometimes happens to old Iſſues.</note> doth enter into a ſeparating turgeſcence, it frequently happens that it diſcharges its recrements and feculencies, otherwiſe unapt to be purged out, about the Fontinel, and there being impeded in its Circuit by them accumulated together, it is extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſated, and for that cauſe brings on a fierce Phlogoſis. Such an affection not long ſince happening in a renowned ancient perſon, and being neglected from its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencing, within a ſhort ſpace of time degenerated into a Gangrene; notwithſtanding from which by the help of appropriated remedies carefully exhibited, as well inward as outward, he eſcaped not without great danger of life.

Sometimes a Fontinel like a dry Fountain pours out little or no humour; the reaſon whereof is uſually, either for that the orifice being not deep enough, doth not penetrate the whole skin, which is cured by piercing it deeper; or the Ulcer though hollow and large enough, yet remains always dry, becauſe the Serum doth not eaſily nor in plenty ſeparate from the maſs of blood, by reaſon of its conſiſtence being too much bound up; and then the only remedy is, to wear ſolid things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Orifice, which may more provoke or twitch the mouths of the Veſſels, for which purpoſe Peaſe made of Ivy-wood, or Box, or of the roots of Gentian or Hermodactyls, are often uſed with ſucceſs.</p>

Wherefore it is better to cloſe that Iſſue (rather than always in vain to fret the skin) or transfer it to ſome other place.</p>

The ſore of an Iſſue tending to healing, and being forbidden, often procures a ſpongious fleſh about the edges, and ſometimes in the hollowneſs it ſelf; the reaſon whereof is, becauſe the nutritious liquor being conveyed to the ends of the Arteries and nervous fibres, and being not immediately waſht away by the ſerous Ichor, fixes there, and beginning to be aſſimilated ſtretches out both theſe veſſels to fill the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity with fleſh, and into theſe rudiments of fleſh both the blood and Animal ſpirits flow moſt copiouſly; and the blood in the mean time being conveyed thither, forms ſprigs of veins within that bulk for its return: Notwithſtanding this fleſh as yet rude and without ſhape, being excluded for the moſt part from the hole, grows up over the edge; and when in this manner it riſes higher than that it may poſſibly be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered and cloathed with skin and Cuticula, it remains always naked and ſpongious. This excreſcency is eaſily enough cured by ſprinkling thereon Eſcharotick powders, of burnt Alum, Colcothar, or Mercury precipitate; for remedies of this kind do eat away the fleſh ſo luxuriating by their acrimony as well as ſtiptickneſs, repel the nutritious humour,<note place="margin">The reaſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of delivered.</note> and lock up the mouths of the Veſſels. As often as that ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous fleſh encreaſes about the ſides of the Iſſue, it is a ſign that the nutritious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour flows thither more plentifully than the excrementitious; and for that cauſe in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients ſo affected that vent proves not always ſo benign. Wherefore, under pretext of this reaſon many are averſe to that remedy (though ſurely it is harmleſs to moſt, although not alike uſefull and advantageous to all.)

                        <p>AFter Attractive Remedies of the <hi>Cuticula</hi> and Skin, namely Iſſues and bliſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Medicines delivered before, by a certain Law of Method we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to handle Diſeaſes of thoſe parts, and other kinds of Remedies of divers ſorts; the true Aetiology of which will afford matter of moſt pleaſant as well as profitable ſpeculation.</p>
                        <p>As for the fabrick and uſes of thoſe parts,<note place="margin">A Deſcription of the Cuticula.</note> it needs not that I ſhould here repeat all things already accurately deſcribed, and well known in Books of Anatomy. It may ſuffice us to note concerning the <hi>Cuticula,</hi> that this outward skin is thin and denſe, without blood and without ſenſe, as deſtitute of Veſſels and Fibres, which cleaving to the inward skin, covers and defends it from outward injuries. This is every where full of pores, into whoſe orifices the Veſſels diſcharging ſweat do open, which <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pighius</hi> viewing more accurately with a Microſcope, a little before their gaping or opening, affirms to be endued with little Valves, for the retaining or free breathing forth of ſweat: but I confeſs they lye hid to me.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Cuticula</hi> being taken away by Fire, or Phaenigmons, the skin appears naked,<note place="margin">Of the Skin.</note> and looks red, by reaſon of the ſanguiferous veſſels. But this is a thicker membrane, as to its greateſt parts, formed of filaments of Veſſels bringing blood, of Nerves, and of nervous Fibres, variouſly interwoven and complicated among themſelves, among which numerous Glandules and Lymphaducts, or Veſſels diſcharging Sweat and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, are thickly interpoſed. The ſubſtance hereof is related to be double by moſt Anatomiſts, the outer is nervous, the inner fleſhy, or rather glandulous; for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of which, the Rind of an Orange is brought. If the skin be viewed naked by a Microſcope, by the renowned <hi>Malpighius</hi>'s obſervations,<note place="margin">The pyramidal Papillae the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan of feeling.</note> Firſt there preſents it ſelf a body in form of a Net, in whoſe thick holes are contained not only paſſages of Sweat, but alſo very many Teats in form of a Pyramid, riſing out of the skin in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel ranks, and paſſing into the <hi>Cuticula,</hi> where being ſtretcht out in length, they are divided as it were into many little Fibres; which the ſame Author hath determin'd to be the ſenſe of touching. Beſides theſe, the ſubſtance of the skin contains very many Glandules,<note place="margin">The Pores and I Glandules of the Skin.</note> by which means the Lympha or watery matter is carryed by the Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaducts or excretory Veſſels, out of the Arteries to the Pores. For indeed the moſt accurate <hi>Stenon</hi> hath obſerved, <hi>that its Glandules lye under every pore;</hi> which become either greater or leſſer, according to the uſe of ſweating: the ſweat or vapours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſtreaming out of theſe by the excretory veſſels, avoiding the excrements, do moiſten the nervous Teats in their paſſages, leſt perchance they ſhould grow dry.</p>
                        <p>As to the pores or paſſages of Sweat,<note place="margin">The Pores two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, greater and leſſer.</note> they are diſcovered by a Microſcope to be of two kinds, <hi>viz.</hi> The greater, in moſt of which the roots of the hairs are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted, and by interſpaces, on both ſides of each wrinkle of the skin, are diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in a parallel rank: Or ſecondly, they are the leſſer Pores, which being num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs, do fill up all the ſpaces between the former in moſt thick Punctums or pricks. For indeed the whole skin with its wrinkles, appears like a Field furrowed by a Plow, and afterwards harrowed with the ranks turned, or rather oblique; ſo that its ground
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:40331:196"/> being eminent above the furrows of either kind, there remain in its plain, Figures very much of a Rhomboidal or a Diamond-faſhion;<note place="margin">The wrinkles and furrows of the Skin.</note> and accordingly as thoſe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, with their banks or flattes, are either ſhorter and leſs, or deeper and greater, the texture of the skin appears either delicate and thin, or thick and courſe. This kind of Conſtitution although it be moſt owing to ones birth, and to the primogenial growing together of the humours, is however manifoldly altered by reaſon of the various accidents of the enſuing life. A more groſs Diet, difficult labour, injury of Air,<note place="margin">From whence the Roughneſs or Fineneſs of the skin.</note> and chiefly exceſs either of heat or cold, render a skin more rough: alſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe a nice and delicate education renders its tone more fine and ſoft.</p>
                        <p>That the skin may become more neat, ſmoothe and equal, it avails much that all its pores be filled with a benign, mild and unctuous humour; for ſo, whileſt all its pores become full,<note place="margin">Depends much on the Humours filling the pores.</note> and extended, the level of the whole skin appears more ſmooth: Notwithſtanding, if a vicious humour furniſh thoſe pores, or the benign humour that was in them be too much exhauſted, for that cauſe the skin will become rough and full of wrinkles. Wherefore if any endowed with a moſt ſoft and even skin, ſhall wet their hands in a Soap Lather, Lie, or Lime-water, or alſo for ſome time in warm Blood, preſently the furrows and wrinkles will grow greater and deeper, the ſaline humour being drawn out by the other Salts out of the pores; wherefore more delicate wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſcrupulouſly decline waſhing with Soap or any other things that furrow the skin.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">From the ſudden ſhutting up of the pores.</note>Neither only the humour being too much exhauſted out of the pores, but alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the ſame either unduely or above meaſure, doth render the skin rough and unequal. The hairy pores (which though they are not the only, yet are much the paſſages of Sweat) do conſtantly ſend out more plentiful Effluvia's for the ſake of tranſpiration, wherefore they ever ſeem greater and more open; but if it ſhall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen that theſe are ſuddenly obſtructed by any outward cold, the Vapours being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained within,<note place="margin">In the larger pores are the roots of the hairs.</note> they do every where ſwell up the skin about the places where they break out, and lift it up into little heaps: from hence if at any time our bodies are expoſed naked to the Northern wind, or are plunged in a River, the exterior Superficies before ſmooth and ſoft, will become rough and rugged, like the skin of a a Gooſe new pull'd. Without doubt thoſe greater pores, being, according to the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of the skin, planted parallel and as it were in a rank after the manner of a <hi>Quincunx</hi> or exact Square, are made as ſo many pitts for the planting of hairs as it were trees; for ſo they appear in four-footed Beaſts, and in ſome hairy parts of men.</p>
                        <p>Theſe things being thus briefly declared concerning the <hi>Cuticula</hi> and Skin, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their frame and uſes, there is way enough made to ſearch and unfold the Diſeaſes of the ſame parts, and the reaſons of healing them.</p>

                           <note place="margin">No Diſeaſes of the Scarf-skin.</note>Wherefore firſt ſcarce any Diſeaſes properly belong to the <hi>Cuticula,</hi> it being devoid of life and ſenſe. This ſometimes being too thick hinders Tranſpiration, and alſo ſometimes by reaſon of accidents in ſome places it grows too thick and callous: but it ſelf being clearly unſenſible it is never ſick, notwithſtanding this is a cauſe that ſome diſtempers which might be blown off by Tranſpiration, do cleave to the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies of the skin, inaſmuch as the dregs of the blood, and humours, and recrements being thruſt forward outwards,<note place="margin">The cauſe of ſome.</note> having paſſed through the whole skin, when they cannot evaporate wholly by reaſon of the thickneſs of the Scarf-skin, being faſtened in the outer skin, produce various diſcolourations, and ſtains thereof; of which ſort are thoſe ſpots called Heat-ſpots, Freckles, or Ephelides, as alſo ſcorbutical and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant ſpots, alſo Pimples and whatſoever other ſtains without any ſwellings or roughneſs do ſeem to beſprinkle the skin or outward Scarf-skin, with marks, or ſome little disfigurings.<note place="margin">The Cutaneous diſtempers rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned up.</note>

                        <p>But truly as to what belongs to the diſtempers of the Skin it ſelf in general, ſince they are various and manifold, they are wont to be diſtinguiſhed under a various reſpect, and chiefly that they are either with or without a Tumour; we have but now taken notice of theſe latter ones.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Diſtempers in the skin with or without a tumour.</note>Diſtempers of the Skin with a Tumour, are either univerſal, diſperſed throughout the whole body; or are particular, being raiſed in theſe or thoſe members, diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed or as it were by chance.</p>
                        <p>The former either happen upon a Feaver, as chiefly the Small-pox, Meaſles, or other malignant wheals, whereto alſo may be added the fleeting puſhes of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants; or happening without a feaver, as the Itch, Tetters, and leprous diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.</p>
                        <pb n="163" facs="tcp:40331:196"/>
                        <p>The outward particular Tumours, or diſperſed ones, for the moſt part do not ſeize upon the skin only, but alſo upon the parts ſubjected, <hi>viz.</hi> now the carne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, another while the tendinous, or membranous or glandulous, and for that cauſe do exiſt of a ſundry diſpoſition, and of a diverſe form. To diſcourſe particularly concerning all theſe, and to aſſign the reaſons of their Cauſes, and Cure of every one, would be a matter not only of an entire Tract, but of a great Volume: Wherefore, for the preſent we will only briefly ſpeak of the Diſtempers merely or for the moſt part Cutaneous (of which ſort are all ſpots and Pimples, as alſo the Scab, or Itch, Tetters, or leprous Maladies): perhaps, an opportunity may happen, when I may treat more ſpecially of Tumours of every kind.</p>
                        <p>Firſt then (that we may begin with Spots as Affections of leſſer moment) thoſe offer themſelves called <hi>Ephelides,</hi> becauſe they are chiefly cauſed from the Suns heat;<note place="margin">
                              <hi>1.</hi> Spots call'd Ephelides.</note> for that cauſe frequent in the Spring, and increaſe moſt in Summer, again in Winter they ſoon vaniſh. Moreover, whereas they happen in the more beautifull perſons, and of a thinner skin, they break out chiefly in thoſe places where the <hi>Cuticula</hi> is moſt thick, and is expoſed to the Sun and Air, <hi>viz.</hi> the face and hands, of a colour yellowiſh or brown, in magnitude of a Flea-bite, but they exiſt unequal and irregular as to their Figure. Theſe differ little or nothing from thoſe browniſh or yellowiſh ſpots which ſome call Lentigines or Freckles, which conſiſting of the bigneſs of a Lentil, mark the parts of the face as it were with many drops.</p>
                        <p>The matter of theſe ſeems to be a more thin portion of the cholerick humour,<note place="margin">The matter and cauſe thereof.</note> allured outwards by the force of the Sun attenuating it, and opening the pores of the skin; which beginning to be evaporated, is fixt to the inſide of the outmoſt skin or <hi>Cuticula,</hi> which it cannot paſs through. Surely it is a ſign theſe ſpots proceed from Choler, or other yellow ſcums of the blood, becauſe they are chiefly familiar to them whoſe hair is yellow. Moreover, the reaſon is manifeſt enough, becauſe they ariſe more often in a fair Complexion, and in thoſe parts expoſed to the Sun and Air; for their more thin skin tranſmits the humour rarified by the ſolar heat ſo far untill it is retained by the thicker Scarf-skin, near the places of iſſuing out. This affection preſages or indicates no evil, as to the ſtate of health; and although in appearance it repreſents ſomething of deformity, notwithſtanding that is made good again, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that it ſignifies them ſo ſpotted, to be endued with a more pure Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
                        <p>Beſides theſe ſmall freckly ſpots there are others much larger,<note place="margin">Lenticular Spots.</note> above a hands breadth in magnitude, which deform the skin in divers places, eſpecially about the breaſt and back, one while with brown, another while with pale or blackiſh ſpots. Theſe at certain times, as I have obſerved in many, being wont to ariſe in certain parts and vaniſh again, are commonly called Liver-ſpots,<note place="margin">Liver Spots falſly ſo called.</note> and thoſe moſt markt with them are thought to have a Liver leſs ſound, or at leaſt not well ſanguifying; which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding is not true on this account, but only inaſmuch as the cholerick humours, when they are not enough ſeparated from the maſs of blood within the Liver, being thruſt forward to the skin do ſo diſcolour it: which fault alſo is imputed to the Spleen; for truly this deformity ariſes, becauſe that the feculencies and excrements of the blood, when not enough received by the Veſſels of ſeparation, are together di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted with the Serum, with which they are conveyed to the skin, and in the ſame place being caſt off by the blood, and deſerted by the ſerous Juice while it is evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, they are faſtened about the outer little holes or pores, even as a moſſie down cleaving to the ſtrait places of a River.</p>

                           <hi>viz.</hi> at which time and in thoſe places men are moſt apt to ſweat: for that ſerous Juice which brought out thoſe dregs from the maſs of blood, into the ſtrait places of the skin, leaves them there, altogether unable to evaporate. This indiſpoſition hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of evil joyned to it, nor is it a ſymptom of any preſent diſeaſe, nor doth it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage any ſuddenly approaching; Moreover, when for the moſt part it happens to places that are covered, and brings no deformity or trouble, there ſeems little or no need of Cure: but becauſe an opinion is frequent with the Vulgar, that the Liver is eminently endangered by theſe ſpots, and neceſſarily requires Medicine, for this cauſe to ſatisfie the importunate, craving Medicines, we are wont to preſcribe, beſides extern Coſmeticks, even inward hepatical Remedies; whoſe uſe although not very neceſſary, yet becauſe from thence the depuration of blood, and opening obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the bowels are diſpatcht, they are not altogether in vain.

Wherefore it is uſefull not only to cleanſe the ſpots of the face, but alſo to take away wheals and its redneſs, as alſo the Diſeaſe of the Eriſypelas. Moreover, ſometimes it happens that many parts of the face, eſpecially the Noſe and Forehead, are markt with moſt thick Specks looking black, as if burnt by Gunpowder, which proceeds from hence, becauſe the ſudatory pores are ſometimes fill'd with a more thick black humour, another while with little worms with black heads (which little Inſects being ſqueezed out of the pores, and expoſed to the Sun, are eaſily ſeen to live, and to move themſelves) and in ſuch a malady of the skin, no Lotion or Oyntments are wont to profit, but what are Mercurial; notwithſtanding to this Hony there is a Thorn at hand more than enough malignant.<note place="margin">Its familiar uſe is not ſafe.</note> For the particles of the Mercury together with its Salts (by which they are divided and ſharpened into ſmall bits) being applyed to the face, do ſhake off the peccant and uncleanly matter out of the Pores, and expell it thence, but having driven it back, they purſue it in, and readily inſinuate with the Blood and nervous Liquor, whoſe temperaments they prejudice. Yea by meeting with theſe they imprint very often on the Brain and ſometimes on the Praecordia and other parts, their virulency that can never be wiped out. From hence it is frequently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that women or men that have long uſed Mercurial Coſmeticks, are troubled with a Vertigo, and convulſive Diſtempers, or are obnoxious to paralytical, and their Teeth grow black, and ſometimes fall out.</p>

                           <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe which happen without any Tumour and Ulceration, and only deform it with ſpotted appearances, we will now in order treat of the more grievous Affections, and thoſe which diſſolve the Unity; and eſpecially of the Pſora or Scab, which in ſundry and frequent places of the whole Body doth much infeſt the skin with a painful Itch, and with ſmall Puſtles and breakings out, being ſometimes dry and often ſcaly, and another while moiſt and diſpoſed to ulceration; and a malady of this ſort is moſt properly the Diſeaſe of that part, conſidering it frequently begins in the very skin by reaſon of ſome outward Contagion, and often receives Cure by certain Remedies applyed to the skin only, at leaſt the reaſon of both holds ſo far, that it is ſeldom otherwiſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook or perfectly cured.</p>
                        <p>The Pſora or Scab is vulgarly deſcribed to be a breaking out of Puſtules and wheals throughout the whole body, here and there,<note place="margin">Its deſcription.</note> procured from a ſharp and ſalt humour heaped up in the Pores of the skin, and that it may be diſcuſſed from thence, indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces a notable Itch, and a neceſſity of ſcratching.</p>
                        <p>That we may ſearch duly into the cauſes of this Diſeaſe, and the reaſon of the ſymptoms, we will more deeply enquire concerning the matter effecting and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct cauſe thereof, that it may certainly be known of what ſort that humour is which is heaped up within the skin, by what means it is either generated there, or comes from ſome other parts, afterwards in what pores or little places it is contained, and how endeavouring to break out, it doth create ſo troubleſom an Itch.</p>

                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">What humour its matter is of.</note>Wherefore about the origine of this Diſeaſe, that we may not impute the fault with the Ancients to the Liver or Spleen, the matter thereof is not any particular humour of the four commonly ſuppoſed ones, not Phlegme, nor yellow Choler, nor black,<note place="margin">Not any of the four common humours.</note> neither alſo the blood apt of it ſelf to be extravaſated; moreover neither doth it ſeem to conſiſt of two or more of theſe humours mixt together. For though ſuch humours be granted, notwithſtanding if this Diſeaſe always conſiſt of them, it would not ſo eaſily be catch'd by a meer and light contagion,<note place="margin">But a humour plac'd in the Glandules of the skin.</note> or receive Cure by an Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alone. Wherefore it is rather to be ſuppoſed, that the morbific matter is the humour of the Lympha conſtantly reſting in the glandules of the skin; notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing degenerating from its genuine diſpoſition, that is to ſay, its volatile-ſalt, into an acid or otherwiſe offending diſpoſition. For when the continual Supplements from the blood come to this ſo depraved, and unceſſantly evaporating, theſe Juices new and old do not eaſily agree, or are united, but boyling together after the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual cuſtom of diſſimilar Salts, they are coagulated into a recrementitious matter, which filling and diſtending the pores of the skin, every where raiſes it into Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; Moreover it ſomething hinders the Blood in its paſſage, and conſtrains it to be extravaſated. From hence thick Puſtules are raiſed, and becauſe that matter paſſing into an Ichor is compelled by the Serum and Blood purſuing it ſtill forward, they riſe up into little heaps; afterwards the Animal Spirits entring inordinately into the nervous Fibres, that they may promote the throwing off that ichor, do cauſe the ſenſe of that troubleſome itch.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">The deſcription of that Juice or Humour.</note>Indeed an inſpection with a Microſcope doth moſt clearly diſcover that there is a lymphous humour in the glandules of the skin which lye under all the ſweating pores, treaſured up for ſome uſes, ſo that according to the plenty and diverſe ſtay thereof, theſe Glandules exiſt more or leſs turgid. This Juice is laid aſide by the Blood, through the Arteries, in theſe Glandules, that this little burthen being caſt off, it might return more eaſily through the veins; in the mean time being repoſed there, it hath its uſes, <hi>viz.</hi> In the firſt place continually moiſtening the miliarie Teats, which lying under the nervous little Fibres, are the proper Senſory of Touching, it preſerves them from dryneſs, which would hinder the Senſe; alſo it imbues the aduſt effluvia's paſſing unceſſantly from the blood being kindled, in their paſſage near the skin, with a certain moiſture, and renders them fit to be voided by the pores; and whileſt part of this humour doth ſo continually evaporate with the Effluviums of the blood, thoſe expenſes are repaired by the Lympha continually freſh, being depoſited by the Arterial blood as is aboveſaid.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">How it dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerates.</note>Notwithſtanding this oeconomy of the Region of the skin is not always ſo regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly kept, but that the glandulous humour falling from its own diſpoſition and functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not only will provoke in the skin, but ſometimes in the whole body, preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural affections of divers ſorts. This growing clammy, and cleaving more obſtinately in the little Cells obſtructs tranſpiration; and immoderate ſweating proceeds from its too plentifully flowing out, and from the ſame reſtagnating inwards, a more than uſual Diureſis.<note place="margin">This is done three ways.</note> Moreover, as to what belongs to the Scab and puſtulous eruptions, that humour as it is wont to be depraved many ways, ſo chiefly theſe three, and it wont to enter into a coagulative diſpoſition with the Serum, being freſh poured out from the blood.<note place="margin">
                              <hi>1.</hi> By reaſon of impure Blood.</note> 
                           <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt the Blood it ſelf being very impure, and alſo diſſolved, it leaves its corruptions and ſuperfluous droſs in the cutaneous Glandules, which in the ſame place putting on the nature of more corrupted ferment, they boyl up with other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventitious Juices, or paſſing by theſe, and are diverſly thickened, and ſo they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get not only puſtulous affections, but alſo leprous of divers kinds. From hence the daily and often eating of Shell-fiſh, and alſo of others; and of ſalted meats that have been hung in the Sun or Smoak; alſo the taking diſagreeing Drinks, and venemous Medicines, do cauſe cutaneous and frequently dreadful eruptions.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>2.</hi> By mere ſtagnation.</note>Secondly, The humour being heaped within the cutaneous Glandules, ſometimes doth not only become puſtulous by a mere ſtagnation, but alſo frequently Louſie. Wherefore, not only they that have been long in priſon, but alſo thoſe who being of a ſedentary life, are uſed to naſtineſs and ſluttiſhneſs, do live obnoxious to the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned maladies; inaſmuch as the cutaneous humour being not at all eventilated, is corrupted by mere ſtanding, after the manner of putrefying water, and ſo it puts on the diſpoſition of a corrupting ferment;<note place="margin">
                              <hi>3.</hi> By Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion received from without.</note> to which moreover Supplements of putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraction come from the blood in the like manner depraved.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, If perhaps theſe Cauſes are wanting, that the glandulous humour of the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:40331:198"/> skin, neither contracts any ſtain from fault of the blood, nor its own proper ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, notwithſtanding virulent ſteams communicated from without, render it no leſs prolific as to thoſe diſeaſes. This is manifeſt by common obſervation eſpecially, foraſmuch as they that have health moſt, and are endowed with the beſt Conſtitutions, ſcarce ever eſcape free from the ſame, if they lye in the ſame Bed either with a ſcabby perſon, or where he hath lately lain: and not only ſo, but moreover the Linnen of the Scabby, oftentimes waſhed with other Linnen have beſtowed the contagion upon others. Surely, the taint of no diſeaſe (the Plague only excepted) is more eaſily or certainly propagated than this of the Mange.</p>
                        <p>If the reaſon of this be enquired into,<note place="margin">The reaſon of its moſt ſudden con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded.</note> we preſently ſay that the liquour ſuſceptive of the ſcabby taint is mightily expoſed, and moſt eaſily diſpoſed unto it; and indeed much more ready to either, than the Blood or Nervous Juice. For the glandulous humour of the skin abounding in the outer ſuperficies of the body, firſt imbibes every atome let in by holes and pores every where open, and anticipates them from the blood. Moreover, that this is ſo ſoon infected with a ſcabby Contagion, both the activity of the ferment communicated cauſes it, and alſo the proneneſs of the glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous liquor to degenerate. For indeed the effluvia's falling from the breaking out of the ſcabby skin, are aptly enough compared to the Yeſt of Ale, remaining on the top as it were its outmoſt Coat; of which if the leaſt portion be taken from thence, and mixed with other new Ale unfermented, preſently it ferments the whole maſs how great ſoever, and changes it into the diſpoſition of the liquor from whence it was taken. Certainly there is a very conſiderable energy, which the particles however ſo ſmall and little, carryed to the higheſt activity, are able to perform; but eſpecially if they fall into a liquor (of which ſort is the cutaneous) made up together of ſubtile particles of ſeveral ſorts, as well partaking of the blood, as of the nervous Juice, and for that cauſe moſt readily apt to be fermented.<note place="margin">The Contagion when any where received, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſpreads over the whole skin.</note> Whereſoever therefore theſe effluvia's of the Contagion aboveſaid hit againſt any outward part of a healthful bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, firſt they will infect the cutaneous humour only planted in that place, but then the particles of this ſo corrupted, being received by the venous blood, and preſently delivered to the Arteries, are diffuſed through the entire habit of the body, and in a ſhort time defile the whole maſs of this Humour, and make it ſcabby.</p>
                        <p>From theſe Cauſes of a Pſora as well adjunct as procuring being unfolded,<note place="margin">Of the Itch.</note> the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the firſt ſymptoms, or breaking out in Puſtules, is manifeſt enough; but as to the other, <hi>viz.</hi> the Itch, as it is troubleſome to Senſe, that the formal reaſon thereof may be known, we ought to conſider to what Senſory or organ of ſenſe it properly belongs, and of what ſort its paſſion or affection ſhould be.</p>
                        <p>Concerning theſe things, firſt it is ſure it belongs to the ſenſe of touching,<note place="margin">It belongs to the Senſe of Feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> and that the firſt Inſtruments hereof are Teats faſhioned like a Millet, and their little Fibres diſperſed through the whole skin, as we have before declared. Moreover with this ſenſe all the nervous fibres are endowed, being diffuſed throughout the whole body. Notwithſtanding, whereas there are two ſupream paſſions of Touching,<note place="margin">Of what ſort its Affection is.</note> and as it were generical, <hi>viz. Pain</hi> and <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> it is deſervedly doubted to which of theſe Itching ought to be related. For the ſolution of which, we ought to ſhew by what means the Animal Spirits, being inmates to the organ of Touch, are affected in Pain, and alſo after what manner in Pleaſure; then their demeanour alſo as to the Itching being deſign'd, it will eaſily be manifeſt of what Province this Paſſion is,<note place="margin">The chief Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are Pain and Pleaſure.</note> and in what things the nature of it, and the manner of its acting do conſiſt. Let the Reader pardon me, if I ſhould by way of digreſſion expound this more at large, and even to tediouſneſs, becauſe this Aetiology ſeems very neceſſary both to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and curing of moſt outward diſtempers. Pain being diſtinct from Sadneſs, and belonging to the Touch, is uſed to be defined,<note place="margin">The formal rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Pain.</note> 
                           <hi>A troubleſome feeling proceeding from the diſſolution of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity.</hi> And indeed it takes its origine as often, and in as much as any ſenſible thing, diſagreeable or improportionate, being applyed to that organ of ſenſe, divides and ſeparates the fibres one from the other; and for that cauſe repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the animal ſpirits inhabiting in them, from their wonted and quiet emanation, diſtracts them from one another, and as it were puts them to flight; then preſently foraſmuch as that outward repulſe of the ſpirits, is communicated by a continued order of other ſpirits, to the firſt organ of Senſe, it ſtirres up the Spirits dwelling there into the like confuſions, ſo a perception is cauſed of grief or pain inflicted outwardly. In truth the whole ſeries of animal ſpirits which are affected with pain, as it were ſome ſingular member of the ſenſitive Soul, conceiving trouble, as it were,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:40331:199"/> from the impreſſion of the object, is forced to be wrinkled with pain, and to contract it ſelf into a leſſer dimenſion.</p>
                        <p>When a diſſolution of Unity is ſaid to be the cauſe of pain, we muſt not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it ſo as if this affection only were cauſed from a wound or blow inflicted upon the body,<note place="margin">The Solution of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the cauſe of it.</note> for the ſame thing is uſed to be induced from cold, heat, wind, from the extravaſating of the blood and of other humours, or their being heaped up together in ſeveral places, oftentimes the faſhioning of the member remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as yet entire; in which caſes, although the continued parts, and chiefly the fibres and filaments, are not at all cut off, notwithſtanding they are in every Affection of grief pulled from their uſual poſition, either by the oppreſſion of the object, or by ſtrange particles forced like wedges, and are compelled into too much tenſion or diſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or divulſion; and for that cauſe the inmate ſpirits being pulled from their mutual embraces, and diſſipated, are ill at eaſe, and incur the paſſion of pain or grief.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">What Pleaſure is.</note>Pleaſure is oppoſed to Pain, and is a manner of Feeling clearly contrary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; which takes its origine, inaſmuch as a pleaſant ſtroaking being made upon the organ of Senſe, the ſpirits flock thither, and preſently being thickly gathered together, and overſpread with a certain delight, they do as it were exult and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce together in the organ: afterwards, inaſmuch as the ſpirits enter into the like triumph or rejoycing within the <hi>Corpus ſtriatum,</hi> a perception of pleaſure is ſtirred up.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Its formal Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note>The greateſt pleaſure which is offered to the Touch, conſiſts in this, that the cauſe of Pain being removed, the parts formerly affected by it, may recover their wonted temper and frame; for ſo the animal ſpirits being before put to flight, and diſperſed from one another,<note place="margin">It chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Pain.</note> they recollect themſelves, and ruſhing into the places from which they were baniſhed with reinforced ſtrength, they prepare themſelves to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce. From hence the Peripateticks placed the formal reaſon of Pleaſure only in the removal of ſomething that was troubleſome, as when the exceſſe of cold or heat is received by an oppoſite and more agreeable ſtate. Indeed the tangible object (becauſe it is alwayes thick and dull) doth ſcarce any way elſe (excepting Venery) allure the animal ſpirits into heaps to the organ of Senſe, unleſs for that it removes their former confuſion.</p>

                           <note place="margin">What the Itch is.</note>From theſe things ſo deſcribed concerning thoſe paſſions, it is eaſily manifeſt, that the Itch according to the formal account thereof, is neither perfectly nor fully either Pain or Pleaſure, but imperfectly and as beginning, partakes of both. For really the ſcabby matter being heaped up within the pores of the skin, and making the ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Unity in many places, enclines towards pain: yet as it is volatile, moving, and haſtens towards vent,<note place="margin">How the Spirits are moved in it.</note> for that cauſe the Animal ſpirits are not put to flight from the Fibres although pulled aſunder, neither are they driven back with ſenſe of pain; but the contrary, as if being ſtronger than the humour infeſting, they were able to caſt it forth, they being wrapp'd up more thick, but irregularly within the cutaneous fibres, do twitch them together variouſly, and draw them on, that they may the ſooner diſcharge the morbific matter, and expell it forth. Wherefore inaſmuch as the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal ſpirits being neither put to flight, nor repulſed, but flowing together in crouds into the organs of Touching, they manage themſelves there tumultuouſly, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly, and as it were by tickling the ſenſible fibres do provoke them into ſmall Convulſions, no pleaſure, but a troubleſom feeling, nor alſo is it Pain, but a Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on clearly diverſe ariſes from it. But as ſoon as by rubbing or ſcratching, the plenty of Spirits aſſembled about the organ of Senſe, begin to be better diſpoſed, and as it were reduced into order, from thence a thorough feeling of Pleaſure is introduced. Wherefore the Itching ſeems to be a middle-ſtate between the beginning of Pain and Pleaſure,<note place="margin">A certain me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium between Pain and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</note> or a paſſage of the Spirits from the rudiments of that, towards the full compleating of this. But from this Phyſical diſcourſe by the by, let us return to our Pathologie or diſcourſe of the diſtemper. From what is above ſaid it is eaſie to collect the differences of this diſeaſe.</p>

                        <p>Concerning the Cure of a Scab or Pſora, two chief Indications preſent themſelves,<note place="margin">The firſt Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation curatory.</note> and each of them two-fold, <hi>viz.</hi> The firſt intention Curatory reſpects theſe two things, Firſt, that the glandulous Humour (its corruptive ferment being wholly extinct) may be reduced to a due temper. Secondly, afterwards that the pores and paſſages of the skin being freed from thoſe Ichorous congealings, may recover their priſtine frame or good temper.</p>
                        <p>The Second Indication Preſervatory takes care to prevent theſe two things, <hi>viz.</hi>

                        <p>All theſe intentions of Curing, by remedies internal as well as external together,<note place="margin">Both inward and outward Medicines are to be taken to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</note> being much and often uſed, ought to be joyn'd together, or at leaſt-wiſe to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us'd, <hi>viz.</hi> that the morbific matter being diſcuſſed from its receſſes, may not depart into and lye hid in any lurking places any where elſe, but from every part, inwardly and outwardly, by remedies taken, may be wholly removed away; wherefore Purgatories ought alwayes to begin and end this method of Curing.<note place="margin">Purges, Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratives, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</note> Although <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> with great pomp overthrows this Cathartick method of Phyſick, and as it were leads it in Triumph, becauſe it doth not cure the Scab by it ſelf, yet we may affirm this Diſeaſe without that remedy can ſcarce ever eaſily be cured, but never ſafely. Moreover Phlebotomy, unleſs ſomething contradict it, is preſently to be celebrated in the beginning; upon theſe, Alteratives that cleanſe the blood and ſtrengthen the bowels, and defend againſt the aſſaults of the morbific matter, challenge their turns; and in the mean time Liniments, or Baths, or topical remedies of another kind, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Cutaneous, are adminiſtred: As without which not only Purging and Bleeding, but alſo Diaphoreticks, Diureticks, yea whatſoever remedyes evacuating blood or humours, or altering them, become uſeleſs.

The Mercurial Coſmetick before deſcribed, being weaker by two degrees, if it be applyed upon the Skin, chiefly on the ulcerated places, it kills the Scab.

                        <p>If the Aetiologie of theſe be enquired into,<note place="margin">Why Sulphur is the Antidote of the Pſora.</note> and firſt why Brimſtone is ſuch a ſpecifick Antidote againſt the Itch, that poor and ordinary men (who have not wherewithall to uſe any other Medicine) do take againſt this Diſtemper inwardly only powder of Brimſtone with Milk, and adminiſter it outwardly with Butter, I have already in part given an account, where we have unfolded the balſamick vertue of Brimſtone towards the Lungs. Namely, it is a good expedient in either caſe, inaſmuch as it deſtroyes the acidities of the Blood and Humours, and all the exotick and corrupting roughneſſes, and reſtores a benign diſpoſition to every Juice, <hi>viz.</hi> a mild and an unctuous:<note place="margin">The Reaſon of it.</note> and ſo the Particles of Brimſtone any way outwardly applyed, do eaſily enter into the pores of the skin, and being admitted inward, do forthwith work upon the ulcerous Ichor there abounding, kill the Salts there predominating, and procure a balſamick na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the cutaneous Juice, that it may aftewards agree with the Blood and Serum continually flowing to it.</p>
                        <p>As to Mercury,<note place="margin">How Mercury cures this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.</note> it is no wonder if Medicines prepared hereof do throughly heal the places of the skin affected with the Pſora wherever applyed, for by the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation hereof, wheals and puſhes, and all malignant ulcers, <hi>viz.</hi> Venereal and Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butick, are wont to be tamed. Neither is it a thing to be admired, that theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies adminiſtred in any private places, as long as they provoke ſalivation, are a Cure of an Univerſal Itch; but really that without ſpitting they can produce ſuch an effect, as that a Girdle wherein Quick-ſilver is ſowed and worn about the Loyns, ſhould aboliſh the Scab of the whole body, and that ſometimes without any ſenſible eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation or harm cauſed thereby, I ſay the reaſon hereof is not ſo eaſily apparent.</p>
                        <p>Yet for the ſolution hereof,<note place="margin">The reaſon of its vertue.</note> we muſt ſay that the Particles of Mercury being able to extinguiſh the ſcabbineſs of every Itchy ferment, when they are applyed to any private part, do preſently take away the Scab of that place; and beſides being caught by the venous blood, and diffuſed through the whole maſſe thereof, and a little after they are not only carryed back by the arterious blood to the ſame

Wherefore, as the names of this Diſtemper are variouſly confounded, and perhaps that as to its nature and formal appearance it has been various in divers Regions, neither may it be altogether the ſame in our generation as in former times, for this cauſe my buſineſs here ſhall not be to deſcribe this diſeaſe according to Books, but from the proper obſervation of the Patients themſelves.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">It is deſcribed according to its appearances.</note>The Impetigo is wont to ariſe and affect after this manner; to wit, little wheals or red puſtules, ſometimes ſingle, and ſometimes many together, are raiſed in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers parts of the body, but chiefly in the Arms or Thighs; to each of which, new ones every where are adjoyned, (the Diſeaſe augmenting) and in a ſhort ſpace of time there become many heaps of riſings of that kind, like cluſters. For the little pimples breaking out daily near to their ſtemme, and ſpreading ſtill larger, diffuſe themſelves into a Circle, and ſo cauſe every heap of Eruptions to be enlarged.

                        <p>Theſe Cluſters of little Pimples being firſt ſmall and fewer, appear perhaps three or four in the Arm or Thigh, or other particular member, about the bigneſs of a Penny or half a dram: but afterwards, if the diſeaſe be ſuffered to augment, they break out every where more frequent, which being leiſurely encreaſed in their ground, afterwards appear to equal or exceed the bigneſs of a Silver Crown, but not always round or of a regular Figure, but diverſly formed. Moreover there is no ſtop in this condition, but the diſtemper, unleſs it be reſtrained with Medicine, breaking out ſtill in more places, and creeping on every where in broadneſs, at length not only covers over the whole member but alſo the whole body with a leprous dry ſcurf; and this kind of Impetigo the Ancients call'd by reaſon of its outrage <gap reason="foreign">

                           <note place="margin">The differences of this diſeaſe.</note>From hence the chief differences of this diſeaſe are made known; and in the firſt place as it is leſs or more malignant according to the faſhion thereof, it is diſtinguſhed, as it comes nearer the nature of the Scab, or Leproſie, or as it is in a middle condition between both. We are alſo to note, this diſtemper ſometimes infeſts ſome particular members, as the Arms or Thighs, the reſt of the body being untoucht; but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it begins together in all parts, and every where excites ſcatteringly little Pim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples or Cluſters thereof. Alſo eruptions of this kind are in ſome for a ſeaſon, or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riodical, and for the moſt part infeſt theſe perſons during Winter only, vaniſhing away about Summer; likewiſe on the contrary, in others they abhorre Winter, and are wont to obſerve the ſeaſon of the Swallow going and coming: but in moſt others the Diſeaſe being continual grants no truce, yea it hath neither remiſſion nor me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diocrity.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">How it differs from the Pſora and Leproſie.</note>Moreover, we muſt diſtinguiſh an Impetigo from other Diſeaſes a-kin to it, and firſt from the Scab, and the Leproſie. It differs from the former as to the form of the Puſtules; for every where in the Pſora they are ſingle and remote from one another, although by ſmall ſpaces; here moſt of them break out in Cluſters, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currently,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:40331:201"/> and as it were disjoyned by branches with great interſpaces. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe diſtempers a notable difference yet ariſes, in that the Scab is wont eaſily or ſcarce otherwiſe to be propagated or ariſe, but by Contagion; but the infection of an Impetigo is ſo ſeldom or never, that the Miaſma from the Husband doth not paſs to the wife, or from her to him, though they lye together.</p>
                        <p>Alſo this Diſeaſe differs from the Leproſie, as well in reſpect of the form of its eruption, as of its contagion, which is likewiſe active in this, as in the Pſora; and the breaking out is much larger and more horrid, <hi>viz.</hi> it is every where ſhelly and ſcaly, without intermiſſion, and diffuſed through the whole body.</p>
                        <p>From hence it is manifeſt, that the material cauſe of an Impetigo,<note place="margin">The material cauſe not a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of the skin.</note> is not merely a cutaneous humour, by reaſon of effluvia's or a taint received from without, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved by reaſon of other accidents, and degenerated from its temperament; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not eaſily communicated to others by Contagion, as in the Pſora, neither is it immediately diſperſed throughout the whole body.<note place="margin">But tartarous Concretions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got in the blood.</note> But indeed little Puſtules breaking out firſt about the initiations of the Diſeaſe ſeem therefore to proceed, for that certain acid ſalt Concretions happen to be in the maſs of Blood (like Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar in Wine) which when they can neither be concocted or again diſſolved, are here thruſt out into the skin, as there into the ſides of the Veſſel. As long as theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions are ſmall and few, they are conveyed into the skin in this or that member, and by one or two branches of an Artery; then as Nature is wont to continue the ſame manner of excretion as it began, the matter being carryed every where by the ſame veſſels, to the ſame neſts, near the firſt wheals it cauſes heaps of others round about them; but afterwards when the dyſcraſie of the blood is daily augmented, and that Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarous matter is generated more plentifully in the maſs thereof, more portions are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed by other Arteries, and ſtill by more to the outward places: and for that cauſe alſo more pimples break out both in the ſame, and in other members, which a new matter coming continually by the ſame Arteries, and being placed cloſe to the former, enlarges them every day, and every where dilates them by the addition of other puſtules; and at length if this ſort of Tartar of the blood augment hugely, being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed out by more or all the Arteries together, it is faſtened in the skin, and in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of time covers over all the ſuperficies thereof with a ſcaly or downright leprous ſhell: And then that cutaneous humour being wholly corrupted, promotes the diſeaſe it ſelf; for it cauſes the ſtock of the morbific matter to be encreaſed, by pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting more, or rather poyſoning the blood and humours, whileſt they paſs in Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; moreover diſmiſſing the corruptive ſteams from it ſelf, it renders the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion of the ſame diſeaſe unto others.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore, both the procuring and conjunct cauſes of this Diſeaſe conſiſt in this,<note place="margin">The next cauſe of it.</note> for that without any fault of the skin, it happens that the blood is filled with ſalt Particles of a various diſpoſition and condition; (into the preceding cauſe of which diſpoſition we will anon inquire) and where thoſe fixt and acid Salts are eſpecially predominant (as the manner is) they mutually embrace one another, and ſo grow together into Tartarous Concretions; which being thruſt forth into the blood, cauſe eruptions of wheals, as it were neſts of the Diſeaſe; then they being daily and leiſurely encreaſed both in number and largeneſs, according to the ſupply of matter, they produce the beginning, augmentation, and ſtate of this diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>As to what relates to the antecedent and evident cauſes,<note place="margin">The evident Cauſes.</note> there are two chief kinds of occaſions from which this diſtemper for the moſt part derives its origine; to wit, an evil manner of Diet, or a taint of the Scurvy, or Pox, or other Diſeaſes left in the body, being ill, or not at all cured. We will weigh a little the reaſons of each of theſe.</p>
                        <p>As to the former, beſides the common irregularities in Diet,<note place="margin">Irregularities in Diet.</note> wherein ſome being too much addicted to eating of fleſh ſalted and afterwards dryed in the Sun or Smoak, and the drinking of acid Wines, do eaſily contract this malady; Alſo it is a vulgar obſervation,<note place="margin">The daily eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Pork or Fiſh.</note> that very many are diſpoſed thereunto by the too frequent or daily feeding on Pork, and Fiſh, and eſpecially Shell-fiſh. There is a notable inſtance of the former, which is, that that food was chiefly forbidden the <hi>Jews</hi> for prevention of this diſeaſe. Alſo there is an example of the other, that in time paſt the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Cornwal</hi> for the moſt part dwelling on the Sea-coaſt, inaſmuch as the poorer ſort were fed with Fiſh, became very obnoxious to Leprous Diſtempers;<note place="margin">The reaſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of inquired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</note> inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that for their relief many Hoſpitals were erected in that Countrey. That I may hint in a few words the reaſon hereof, I am apt to think whether that food is rancid,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:40331:202"/> or otherwiſe improportionate, that it conveys particles not rightly mixed, nor eaſily to be ſubdued to our blood, which being ſo heterogeneous and largely heapt up by a long uſe of ſuch Diet, the ſaline particles of which kinde do eaſily aſſociate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſo do conſtitute Tartarous Coagulations to be exterminated in the skin, and the ſeeds of the Leproſie or of the Impetiginous Evil.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">It often follows the Pox and Scurvy.</note>But yet a plentiful Crop is begot from the taint of the Scurvy and Pox left in the body, and afterwards by the combination of Salts and Sulphur exalted to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity. We have elſewhere diſcovered the reaſons of the former diſeaſe, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the foreſaid ſymptome coming after it, which being accommodated to our preſent Hypotheſis do make it more clear. And it ſo often happens, that puſtulous eruptions of this ſort do follow an inveterate Pox, although it ſeem to be cured, that none diſtempered almoſt with theſe, wants the ſuſpicion of that ſhamefull Diſeaſe; ſo that the firſt Queſtion of a Phyſician in ſuch a caſe being conſulted, is, Whether the Patient have not at ſome time formerly contracted that Diſtemper? For ſurely the Corruptions of the blood, after they are by a long ſtay become altogether heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous and indomitable, at length acquire to themſelves ſalt Particles, wherewith growing into ſuch like Tartarous Concretes, and being thruſt forth into the skin, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce thoſe Impetiginous Puſtules.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Its Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks.</note>As to the Prognoſtick part of this Diſeaſe, although it ſeldom threatens death or imminent danger, yet after it hath taken deep root, the Cure is very difficult, if at all: The Impetigo firſt beginning, and exciting a few Puſtules, and knots of them, perhaps in one or two members, ſometimes admits of Cure, but hardly without a moſt efficacious remedy. But if the Diſeaſe proceed ſo far, that the frequent and broad cluſters of wheals appear diſpers'd throughout the body, then ſmall remedies effect nothing, and the great ones howſoever diligently obſerved, will not eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form a Cure. But if the Diſeaſe, maugre all remedies advance daily, and encreaſe at length into a Leproſie, <hi>Celſus</hi> judges it impoſſible to be cured, and therefore we muſt wholly abſtain from it.</p>
                        <p>

The Method of Curing ought to begin with the Preſervatory Indication, which takes away the Cauſes of the Diſeaſe by inward remedies, for otherwiſe external (as in the Pſora) are never adminiſtred with ſucceſs; but the roots of the diſeaſe in the blood being cut off, the cutaneous ſproutings quickly conſume away: for the taking them away, we muſt proceed in one manner when the Impetigo begins by it ſelf, and in ſomewhat a different manner when it follows an inveterate Scurvy or Pox, being ill or not at all cured.

                           <note place="margin">A notable Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>Some years ſince a Virgin of a Noble Family, being of a hot Temperament, and endowed naturally with a ſharp and ſalt blood, after being a long time obnoxious to an Impetigo, almoſt from her Cradle, about her riper years began to be afflicted more grievouſly; for the cluſters of ſcaly Puſtules covered not only her Arms and Thighs every where, and the other covered parts of her body, but alſo her Hands and Face were ſo defiled, that ſhe was aſhamed to appear abroad or converſe with others of her rank. Leſſer remedies almoſt innumerable were exhibited without ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; by uſing Baths ſhe at firſt appeared relieved, but at length grew worſe thereby. <hi>Aſtrope</hi> Wells which have cured ſome, afforded her little or no relief. Wherefore, when all ordinary means would not effect any thing, I propounded Salivation, as a remedy more prevalent than all the reſt and (as it is accounted) the laſt. When the Parents and Patient readily conſented to this advice, preparing her body duely by Purgation and Phlebotomy,<note place="margin">Salivation cures for a time the Impetigo, but with a relapſe.</note> I gave her (after our manner) Pills of Solar Praecipitate two dayes, and after the interval of one day, the remedy being repeated the next, an abundant and laudable ſpitting began, and continued for a month without any ill ſymptome; to keep which in its due tenour, I applyed a Mercurial Oyntment to the bending of the Joynts and the places moſt affected one while to one, another while to another. Before the finiſhing of this courſe, all the Eruptions vaniſhed; notwithſtanding to confirm the Cure, as alſo for the extirpation of the Mercury, ſhe remained another month in Purging, Sweating, and Diet of the Decoction of <hi>Sarſa, China,</hi> &amp;c. in which time ſeeming perfectly cured, ſhe ſo remained for about forty dayes. But afterwards though ſhe obſerved an exact courſe of Diet, the ſame diſeaſe began to bud forth again, and leiſurely encreaſing, at length it advanced into its former ſtate. I being confounded with this event, perſwaded her to hope an alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for the better after her Menſtrual Flux, which was ſuddenly expected. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:40331:205"/> after long delay that Criſis at length happening, and managing her ſelf regularly after it, brought no Cure or eaſe of that Diſeaſe, but rather a freſh aſſault. Whereupon recourſe was had again to Phyſick, and divers Remedies aſſay'd, all which when they became fruſtrate,<note place="margin">That remedy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, did not thoroughly cure the Diſeaſe.</note> her friends importuned that ſhe might ſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate again, to wit, allured by this hope, that that method which cured her for a ſhort ſpace, being adminiſter'd again, would cure her either for a longer ſpace or altogether. Wherefore according to their wiſhes, the ſame courſe of ſpitting and ſweating re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated for two months ſpace, and thereupon the Puſtules every where going off, the Noble Virgin ſeem'd again wholly to recover her health. But within a fortnight after the courſe finiſhed, the Puſtules and their Cluſters again appeared, and leiſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly encreaſing daily in number and bulk at length grew fouler than before, inſomuch that like an <hi>Hydra,</hi> after the loſs of one head this diſeaſe received ſevenfold.</p>
                        <p>I knew another ſtrong man endowed with a luſty habit of Body, who after he had laboured with an Impetigo many years, the malady ſtill encreaſing, and being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd to the higheſt, he was covered all over with a white Scurf, as it were leprous, that every night the Scales fell off like Bran in great plenty in his bed, and might be gathered up in heaps. This man for Cures ſake firſt tryed the ordinary Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of every kinde, notwithſtanding without ſucceſs; and afterwards trying a lighter Salivation, found himſelf nothing better: but afterwards the ſame method being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, by a long and painful Spitting, he ſeemed to be reſtored to health; but within three months the ſame diſeaſe budding out, in a ſhort ſpace arrived to its former outragiouſneſs; Moreover, when he had undergone the third time that moſt painful Remedy, that affect, which ſeemed expulſed for a certain time, returned again; and afterwards maugre this and all methods, it exercis'd its Tyranny during the Patients life. It will not be requiſite here to diſcourſe any thing of the <hi>Lepra,</hi> which being only a more intenſe degree of the former Malady, for the moſt part admits of no Cure. As to what relates to other Tumours, and their manifold kinds, and the Aetiologies or Reaſons of each, I confeſs I am ſcarce able to contain my ſelf, but that I ſhould enter upon that pleaſant Field of Speculation. But this ſeems as irrational and unuſual, as for one wearyed with a long Courſe, and breathleſs at the end, running beyond his Poſt, preſently to begin a new Race.</p>

For we are to inform you, that the Scurvy may be produced by reaſon of ſeveral Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and occaſions: for although an ill courſe of Diet, a ſedentary life, the inordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spleen, and the Crudities heaped up in the firſt paſſages are very much accuſed; yet there is wont to be a further cauſe, as the unwholſomneſs of the Air, and the evil <hi>Craſis</hi> of the Blood, vitiated by former Diſeaſes: wherefore the Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy or Scorbute is often venacular or peculiar to mariſh places, and to the Sea Coaſts: and frequently falls on thoſe who much uſe the Sea, and feed much upon ſalt and ſmoak-dry'd Meats, and who are forced to drink putrefied Water: and often ſucceeds to continual Fevers, and to other chronical Diſeaſes ill cured; alſo to great Haemorrhagies and other evacuations; and to uſual excretions, as the Piles and monthly courſes being ſuppreſſed: Moreover this Diſeaſe, without any great forerunning cauſe, is excited not ſeldome by contagion, and ſometimes is alſo hereditary.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The cauſe of the Diſeaſe diffuſed thorow the body ſticks ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note>It manifeſtly appears, from what we have obſerved concerning this ſcorbutick Affection, that the material cauſe of this Diſeaſe is not contained in any private place or ſingular mine, but is diffuſed thorow the whole body and every part of it, both within and without: from whence we gather that the ſcorbutick Miaſm or
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40331:207"/> Contagion, is poured forth, either in the Blood or in the Nervous Juice or in both: And indeed, the eruptions of Spots, and little whelks, the redneſs, and as it were lixivate urine, or like lie, plainly teſtifie the Contagion to be placed in the effervency and inordinatneſs of the Blood;<note place="margin">To the Blood or to the nervous Juice or to both</note> to which another like progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick may be added, the divers production of this diſeaſe, which for the moſt part ſucceeds the depravation of the maſs of Blood: no leſs do the troubleſome dolors, both within in the Membranes, and without in the Muſcles, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the Members or reſolutious, the <hi>Vertigo,</hi> Cramps, and frequent faintings of the Spirits declare the fault or vice to be in the nervous Juice. Therefore, when both the general Humours are in fault, we will ſee which is firſt and chiefly vitiated, and from whence it draws its Contagion, and by what means it communicates its harm to another humour, and to any other parts, that are wont to be affected.</p>
                     <p>As to the Blood (in whoſe maſs the Scurvy ſeems moſt of all to be rooted) we have elſwhere ſhown, that its diſpoſition is even almoſt of the ſame temper, and of ſuch like particles compoſed, as Wine: for that we have hinted,<note place="margin">The Dyſcraſie of Blood and Wine Compared.</note> the Blood, even as Wine; to be ſick, chiefly from two cauſes, to wit, either, becauſe that there is ſomething extraneous, and not to be truely mingled with it, poured into one or the other, or elſe becauſe the diſpoſition of the Liquor, or its temperament is perverted, that is, for as much as ſome things that are to be in Subjection, either to one Element or to another, and which ought to be ſubjugated, are exalted.</p>
                     <p>As to the firſt we have obſerv'd of ſome, that when the <hi>faeces,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">As to things not miſcible pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into either.</note> are firſt ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and thruſt up from the bottom, they are by being moved, lifted up; or if any exotick thing be caſt into the Pipe, as Sewet or Sulphur, preſently a notable perturbation is ſtird up; by which, unleſs it be ſoon quieted, the whole <hi>Craſis</hi> of the Wine will be in danger to be ſubverted. In like manner there are many things not miſcible, which diſturb the Motion and Circulation of the Blood, by being poured into it, and hinder it, that it cannot perform its due oeconomy, the nutritious Juice being full of the feculences, does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinatly ferment the Blood, and as we have formerly ſhown, that Liquor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming degenerate, ſtirs up the paroxyſms of intermitting fevours; the vaporous Recrements of the Blood, the ſerous, bilous, and melancholy being retained in the boſom of it, bring forth Catarrhs, Dropſies, Jaundice, Melancholy, and many other Diſeaſes: but if that extraneous thing be removed in time, it ſoon, even as Wine freed from its extraneous mixture, recovers its priſtine Condition. But either Liquor, being for a long time infected with thoſe heterogeneous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, ſo that the due <hi>Craſis</hi> is at length degenerate, it is not then eaſily to be reſtored.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Beſides, both Wine, and Blood, by reaſon of many other cauſes,<note place="margin">As to the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of either va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly altered;</note> depart from their right Temperament. As to Wine there are many ways and reaſons where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by its Liquor is perverted from its legitimate diſpoſition: which may alſo be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd, by as many, if not more, in the dyſcraſie of the Blood. (For this is often wont to be ſuddenly empoyſon'd and broken, which does not eaſily happen to Wine) 1. Therefore, we may obſerve of Wines, that they do not ſometimes attain to maturity, but for want of Spirit they remain crude, for as much as the Spirits, and the other active principles of Sulphur and Salt being overwhelmed with more thick and groſs parts, cannot extricate themſelves; wherefore they become without Spirit, but having a thick conſiſtence, and ungrateful taſte, degenerate into a taſtleſs Wine: and almoſt after the ſame way it is, when the Blood, the Spirit, and Sulphur depreſſed, becomes crude and watry, and without Vigor, and unable to be inkindled afreſh in the Heart. And this kind of diſpoſition of the Blood <hi>Horſtius</hi> affirms to be the cauſe of the ſcorbutick affection, but this ſame diſpoſition, ſeems rather to infer the <hi>Pica,</hi> or ſtrange longings of women with child, as alſo the Dropſical diſpoſition, than the Scurvy, as we ſhall ſhew more at large anon. 2. The ſulphureous parts of Wine being exalted above the reſt, cauſe an immoderate efferveſcency or ebullition in the Liquor, and is called in our idiom or proper Speech, <hi>Fretting of Wine:</hi> In like manner, the ſulphureous parts of the Blood being too much provoked or carried forth, cauſes a feveriſh intemperance, and is apt to be inflamed in the Heart, and indeed is the cauſe of very many fevers together. 3. Not ſeldom the Spirit in Wines growing weak
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40331:208"/> and the Sulphur being bound up, the ſaline part being carried into a flux over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the reſt; wherefore the Liquor becomes ſour. The famous <hi>Sennertus</hi> thinks the Blood in the Scurvy to be altered as Wine degenerated into Vinegar, which we ſhall ſhew by and by,<note place="margin">The Scorbutick Dycraſie of the Blood like Wines when they become.</note> to be otherways. And we have formerly ſhewed, the dyſcraſie of the Blood, being grown four, cauſes Melancholy. 4. There yet remains another ill diſpoſition of Wines, to which we may very aptly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the ſcorbutick Diſpoſition of the Blood, to wit, when the Spirit being depreſſed, the ſulphureous and the ſaline Particles being combined together, are exalted, and as this comes to paſs in Wines, after a two fold manner, ſo alſo by the like affection of the Blood we may deduce from thence a two fold Kind of Scurvy, as we ſhall ſhew more clearly anon. It is then a common obſervation in Wines, that beſides their degenerating into a taſtleſs Liquor, and into ſour Vineger, they do ſometimes, the Spirit being depreſſed, and the Sulphur and Salt being toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exalted, become rancid, or ropy, or mucilaginous; in proper terms, <hi>Wines that are fretted,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Fretted or Ropy</note> 
                        <hi>or ropy.</hi> In either mutation, the Spirit being ſubjugated, the ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous and the ſaline Particles being aſſociated together, exceed the reſt of the Elements, and cauſe the diſpoſition of the Liquor, to become of their Nature. But yet the buſineſs is not performed, altogether after the ſame manner, in both: for that in the former dyſcraſie of the Wine the Sulphur is ſomething more potent, than the Salt, but in the latter the Salt exceeds the Sulphur: ſo that either of them being the ſtronger, their Lord, the Spirit, being caſt off; they agree one with the other, and ſurmount the due tenour. The reaſon of either, may ſeem to be unfolded after this manner.</p>
                     <p>When generous Wines have grown hot for a long while, the particles being much agitated and ſtriking one againſt another, the Spirit partly evaporates, and partly overwhelmed in the more thick Elements, is ſuppreſſed: In the mean time, the Sulphur (of which there is the greater plenty) being more carried forth by the agitation, and ſo caſting off the yoak of the Spirit, adheres to the Salt, and lifting that up, alters the mixture of the Liquor, which by reaſon of the riſing up of the Sulphur combined with the Salt, becomes rancid, or fretted: In like manner, when thin Wines have been kept long, the Salt is carried forth, and diſpreſſes the Spirit, overcome by its <hi>fluor,</hi> and ſo ſubjected by its watriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the Liquor becomes ſour, or ſharp; after that the Salt growing eminent, the Sulphur (of which there is a leſs quantity) cleaving to it, and intimately uniting, converts the Conſiſtency of the Liquor from thin to thick, and as it were of an oily ſubſtance; and from an acid, four taſt to a very ingratefull, and as it were muſty.</p>
                     <p>It is probable that after the ſame manner the Blood is altered in the affection of the Scurvy, as Wines, as often as they become too hot, degenerate into fretted and ropy; for it is an argument, that this diſeaſe does not depend ſo much on the feculencies mixed with the Blood (though ſuch ſhould he there, they might be at laſt driven forth, and their ſupplies cut off) but on the habitual dyſcraſie of the Blood; becauſe the Scurvy being radicated, is ſo difficult and ſometimes not at all, to be cured. Moreover we may affirm, the dyſcraſie of the Blood which cauſes the Scurvy, to be two fold, as of the Wine, to wit, a ſulphureous-ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line and a ſaline-ſulphureous diſpoſition. For as there are very great variety of affections, which are ſtirred up by the Scurvy; yet all of them may be aptly enough reduced to two principal Heads, or as it were two Fountains of evill, to wit firſt, that the blood being touched with the ſcorbutick Miaſm or Contagion, becomes ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther very fervid or hot, in which the Sulphur having dominion, aſſociates it ſelf pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully with the Salt: wherefore it being made more rancid or fretting, grows inordinately hot in the veſſels, and perpetually ſends forth from it ſelf aduſt recrements, to wit, concretions of Sulphur and Salt, and diſperſes them here and there, which ſpreading outwardly, produce ſpots, pimples, whelks, or ulcers: but being inwardly layd up, bring forth a diſpoſition to Vomit, pains about the heart, Looſneſs, Fluxes and grievous pains. In this kind of Scorbutick rancidity or frettedneſs of the Blood, temperate Remedies only are convenient, and often Blood-letting, Scurvigraſs, Horſe-radiſh, or other things endued with a ſharpneſs and incitation: even by the like means as fretted Wines are cur'd, by diſcharging them from their <hi>faeces,</hi> and by pouring into them, Milk, Flower, or Starch, Glew, or other Demulſions or Sweetnings this is helped. Or in the ſecond place, in blood
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40331:208"/> nouriſhing the Scurvy, Salt has the chief dominion, and aſſociates Sulphur to it ſelf: wherefore it is not ſo fervid, but like ropy Wine becomes thick and muci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laginous, and is ſlowly circulated in the Veſſels, and is apt to ſtuff the <hi>Viſcera</hi> in its paſſage, and to affix there its feculencies as it were mud. Thoſe affected after this manner, for the moſt part without any puſtulaes or eruptions of the skin, become ſluggiſh, breathleſs and feeble<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and labour with ſpontaneous weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſtraitneſs of the Breaſt; and are found to be obnoxious to the paſſions of the Heart, the <hi>Vertigo,</hi> and Convulſions: In the ſcorbutick diſpoſition of this kind, more hot Remedies, and ſuch as are indued with a volatile Salt, yea Chalybeates or ſteel Medicines, which may fuſe and agitate thorowly the Blood, are wont to be moſt uſed, and are to be handled even after the ſame way, as ropy Wines, to wit, to be ſoundly ſhaken and agitated; and alſo to them are put Lime, burnt Allum, <hi>Gypſum</hi> or Plaſtering, Sea ſalt calcined, and the like indued with an high acritude or ſharpneſs. So much for the beginnings of the Scurvy radicated in the Maſs of Blood: There yet remains to be unfolded, for what cauſes the Blood degenerating from its proper nature, conceives this or that morbifick diſpoſition, bringing forth the Scurvy. But it firſt behoves us to ſhew by what means the ſeeds of this Diſeaſe lye hid in the nervous juice, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther general humour.</p>
                     <p>We have elſewhere declared that from the Blood driven to the confines of the Brain, there doth diſtil a ſubtle Liquor,<note place="margin">By what means the ſcorbutick Contagion is impreſſed on the nervous Juice.</note> both for the matter and for the vehicle of the animal Spirits, and that it doth diſperſe it ſelf every where thorow the <hi>Encephalon</hi> and the nervous Stock: This <hi>Latex,</hi> ſo long as it is right and good, conſiſts chiefly of Spirit and Salt combined or volatiliſed in it, and with theſe and the <hi>modicum</hi> of Water, wherewith they are waſhed, there ſeems to be little need of Sulphur and Earth: but yet this concretion of Spirit and volatile Salt doth indeed conſtitute the moſt precious humour which penetrates, paſſes thorow, actuates, and irradiates all things, concerning which the Chymiſts have dreamt of their <hi>Alchaeſt.</hi> At the beginning of the Scurvy, whilſt the <hi>Craſis</hi> of the Blood and the tone of the Brain are not thorowly vitiated, this watring liquor of the Brain and Nerves, being as yet ſpirituous, ſweet, and not very unfit, performs performs all the functions to which it is deſtinated: but afterwards out of the bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Maſs made poor and very much weakned, a much thinner <hi>Latex</hi> and inclining towards Vinegar drops forth: and further, from the foeculented Blood and as it were rancid or fretted or ropy heterogeneous Particles and very much infeſted are carried to the animal Regiment, and that being made weak within the brain, they are admitted without repulſe, and thence poured forth with the moiſtning Juice on its <hi>Appendix,</hi> both medullar and nervous: and from hence in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Regions of the flowing animal Spirits, ſometimes faintings and wanting of ſtrength, ſometimes painful and ſpaſmodick, or cramplike diſtractions, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploſions do follow. Wherefore a <hi>Paralyſis</hi> or Palſy, Convulſions, <hi>Vertigo</hi> or turning round or giddineſs in the head,, tremblings, and other preternatural Affections of the Brain and nervous Stock, are wont to fall on thoſe who have the Scurvy deeply rooted: concerning which we will hereafter ſpeak more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly. In the mean time we will take notice in general, that the ſcorbutick Contagion affixed in the nervous Juice, conſiſts in one of theſe three or in all of them together, <hi>viz.</hi> that the moiſtning of the Brain and Nerves becomes much thinner or poorer; or that it degenerates from its ſaline diſpoſition into ſourneſs; or that it is ſtuft with heterogeneous Particles.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto we have ſhown after what manner the firſt ſeeds as it were of the ſcorbutick Affection are ſown in the Blood, and from thence in the nervous Juice. Before we will conſider of the fruits or ſymptoms of the Diſeaſe, excited by reaſon of the evil diſpoſition of either of the humours and the reaſons of them, and their manner of becoming ſo; we muſt inquire into the more remote cauſes and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of the Diſeaſe it ſelf: to wit, that it may appear from what cauſes or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, and by what proviſion the ſcorbutick diſpoſition is impreſſed on the aforeſaid humours.</p>

                     <p>HAving ſhown in the former Chapter, what is the conjuct and neareſt cauſe of the Scurvy, <hi>viz.</hi> the evil diſpoſition impreſſed on the Blood and nervous Juice, it now remains, that we inquire into the more remote Cauſes, by which the Contagion of either humour, and chiefly of that which is chiefly and firſt in fault, is carried into the Blood: for the depravation of this being detected, it will eaſily appear, how the morbifick Miaſm or Contagion is derived to the other Juice. Therefore as we have determined, that the ſcorbutick Affection is chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly founded in the vitiated Blood, and that the evil of it conſiſts, whilſt the Spirit is depreſſed, in that the Salt and Sulphur, as in Wines becoming fretting and ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, is unduly exalted; we will ſeriouſly conſider, how this or that diſpoſition is impreſſed in the maſs of Blood.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The opinions of others concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of the Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy recited.</note>But we ought not to paſs over what other Authors, diligently ſearching after the nature of the Scurvy, have determined concerning its Cauſes and Subject. As there are many opinions of this thing, almoſt all agree in this reſpect, that the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and origine of this Diſeaſe is derived from the fault of the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> and the ſeat of its product is placed in the bloody Maſs, to wit, that this being almoſt only infected with their vitiouſneſs, contracts the ſcorbutick Contagion. The more Ancient did impute the chief cauſe of this Diſeaſe to the Spleen, not rightly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming its office: but as the office of the Spleen was conceived this thing by ſome, another thing by others, and a different thing by theſe; they ſhewed the production of this Diſeaſe after a ſeveral manner. <hi>Wierius, Echtius, Albertus, Ronſſeus, Eugalenus</hi> with many others, ſuppoſing that the Spleen was the recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the excrementitious melancholick Juice ſeparated from the Blood, have determined the internal and next cauſe of the Scurvy, to be a plenty of lutulent or muddy humour, and of melancholy only, or alſo of that mixed with others, framing a peculiar form of corruption, which abounds about the Spleen and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and in the Veins themſelves, This opinion might deſervedly challenge our aſſent, if it had pronounced the ſecretion of the melancholick Juice from the Spleen being neglected or hindred, to be ſometimes and in part the cauſe of the Scurvy; but that this Diſeaſe is held to ariſe always and altogether from the default of the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> is very highly improbable; as will hereafter be made plain, when we ſhall declare the far more potent cauſes of the Scurvy. Other Authors attributing the office of ſanguification to the Spleen, ſay that the Scurvy is produced, for that the Spleen does not turn that part of the Chyle deſtinated to its ſelf, into laudable Blood. But again others as <hi>Reuſnerus, &amp;c.</hi> have thought the more humid and watry parts of the Chyle to be prepared in the Spleen, and to be converted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Blood. Therefore they judged the next and internal cauſe of the Scurvy to be the watry and ſerous humours, which not being received by the Spleen, were poured on the Blood, and ſo produced the original of the Scurvy. In the mean time others, as <hi>Platerus, Bauhinus, &amp;c.</hi> ſayd that the thicker part of the Chyle being drawn by the Spleen, was the cauſe of ſanguification, and by it to be prepared for it ſelf, and other parts convenient Blood. From this ſuppoſition <hi>Gregory Horſtius</hi> ſaid the cauſe of the Scurvy to be the crude and ichorous Blood in the whole Body, but yet chiefly in the <hi>Hypochondria,</hi> offending not only in quantity but with a kind of ſpecifick corruption, proceeding from the imbecillity of the Spleen, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe thorow the preternatural Affection of the Spleen, the more crude parts of the Chyle, are not averted from the ſanguification of the Liver, from whence the blood in the veins of the Liver and Spleen is firſt depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40331:209"/> and then by the Commixtion of ſtrange matter the Sanguification of the Liver is hindred, by reaſon of the object not righly diſpoſed, for as much as the chyle, by reaſon of the hurt of the Spleen, was not depurated in its juſt meaſure. <hi>Horſ. appen. ad. lib.</hi> 2 <hi>part.</hi> 2 <hi>Sect.</hi> 1 <hi>de Scorbuto.</hi> This opinion eaſily falls to the Ground, becauſe he aſſerts, contrary to the Laws of Sanguification, the Spleen to ſanguifie and to draw the more crude parts of the chyle to it ſelf; when tis well known, there is no paſſage for the Chyle to the Spleen. Alſo this miſtake is refelled by the opinion of <hi>Reuſnerus</hi> and others, which affirm the next and internal cauſe of the Scurvy to be the ſerous and watry hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours which the Spleen ought to draw, and by its peculiar office of Sanguifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to convert into Blood.</p>
                     <p>The moſt learned <hi>Sennertus,</hi> although with the former he artributes alſo the office of Sanguification to the Spleen, <hi>Inſtitut. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 9 yet he derives the cauſe of the Scurvy otherways than from the fault of this <hi>Viſcus.</hi> For he affirms, that by reaſon of the evil Concoction of the Chyle in the firſt paſſages, and being deſtitute of Spirit, ſalt and tartareous Feculencies to be heaped up, about the Meſentery and Cawl, and theſe being continually augmented by the approach of new matter, and moiſtened by the <hi>Serum,</hi> to be at laſt transferred into the Spleen and Liver, and from thence into the Stock of the veins, and ſo in them to infect the whole bloody Maſs, and to render it crude and ſalt. He calls this firſt Mine of the Scurvy, gathered together in the firſt paſſages, a melancholy Humour; which beſides he ſays to be ſerous, ſtopped up with pituitous humours, and by reaſon of its ſtay in thoſe parts, corrupted after a peculiar manner: Then he adds, that this humour is generated by the fixion of the Spirit and volatile Salt, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame manner, when as Wine changes into Vinegar.</p>
                     <p>Several Reaſons of no ſmall moment do convince me,<note place="margin">The Scarvy does not always ariſe by the fault of the Spleen or the firſt paſſages.</note> that I cannot in all things aſſent to this opinion; however probable it ſeems. For beſides that this Doctrine does not exactly quadrate with the Circulation of the Blood, ſince by its Law the humours in the meſaraic veſſels are ſcarcely gathered together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the other kind of Veſſels, at leaſt there is not any paſſage for them from thence into the Spleen, moreover it is not rightly determined, that the Scurvy begins only in the firſt paſſages; for ſometimes it is contracted by mere Contagion. Neither alſo do we think that this Diſeaſe proceeds from the fixed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Salt, or from the Crudity of the Blood and humours: for oftentimes it ſucceeds to long continued Fevers, and that rather ſeems to proceed from aduſtion and too great deflagration of the Blood, than from any advention of the Chyle and other humours in the firſt paſſages: moreover ſometimes a Sea and mariſh air induces this Diſeaſe, though no Crudities are begotten about the <hi>Viſcera:</hi> and the ſick do not complain from the beginning, of their Appetite and Digeſtion. Indeed wee grant, as to what belongs to the Crudity and the fixity of the Salt, in the Chyme (or ſecond digeſtion) or the Blood, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Spirit, that from theſe cauſes a ſickly Diſpoſition is oftentimes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, but not therefore preſently the Scurvy, but rather the <hi>Malacia</hi> of long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing women, <hi>Pica</hi> of Virgins, the phlegmatick Dropſie, or ſome other dropſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal diſpoſition ſucceed. Therefore ſince the Scorbutick Aetiology hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverd by Authors, to whom the Circulation of the Blood was not known, and agrees leſs with the Truth, we will open the whole matter will that Key, and to the beſt of our Skill more accurately unfold the cauſes, both procatar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick and evident, of this Diſeaſe, according to the Law of Sanguification.</p>
                     <p>We have already hinted that there are many occaſions and procatartick means from which the Scurvy ſeems to deduce its original. 1. In ſome places it becomes national or peculiar, ſo that the morbifick Contagion is drawn in together with the vital Spirit, by reaſon of the evil Influence of the Air, and of the vapours, wherewith it is ſtuffed 2. Very often this Diſeaſe follows upon long continued fevers, and other Chronical Diſeaſes and is very deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accounted the affects or products of them 3. Sometimes it is heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, and is propagated by traduction from Scorbutick Parents 4. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times again it is taken by mere Contagion 5. An evil manner of living, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinations as to the things non-natural, an innate or acquired Dyſcraſie of the <hi>Viſcera</hi> ſometimes induce a Scorbutick affection, more often contribute to its birth, or nouriſh the inkindling. We will conſider the reaſons of every one of theſe effects.</p>

There is none of the ordinary ſort of People, but confeſſes that the Scurvy is very often contracted by the fault of the Air, and it is almoſt in every bodies mouth, that places neer the ſea ſide, mariſh lakes, and moiſt places, render the dwellers obnoxious to intermitting Fevers,<note place="margin">By what means unhealthfull Air breeds the Scurvy.</note> or the Scurvy: wherefore the ſickly, or ſuch who have any regard to their health, do chooſe their habitations far from ſuch kind of places. Indeed ſuch an humid Air, continually diffuſing filthy exhalations and infection, becomes unwholſome in a double reſpect, and often brings forth the Scurvy, <hi>viz.</hi> by reaſon of Tranſpiration being hindred: and becauſe of the ſuſception of an incongruous Ferment. For in the firſt place, people dwelling in a thick and not purified Air have the paſſages and Pores of their skin much cloſer, or ſhut up: wherefore when the <hi>Effluvia</hi> of the Blood are not duly exhaled, but the ſame retained within, ferments the reſt of the bloody Maſs, and diſpoſes its active particles to various inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinations. Then in the ſecond place, for as much as at the ſame time filthy va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, ſtinking, incongruous Salt and Sulphurs are ſucked in, by reaſon that the Spirits of the Blood are greatly depreſſed, and in the mean time its ſulphurous and ſaline particles are carried forth to the extremity, and from thence the <hi>Craſis</hi> of the ſanguineous Maſs being by degrees changed, it degenerates into an evil diſpoſition. And indeed, the ſulphureous part of which being exalted by it ſelf induces a notable rancour to the Blood; and there is wont to be excited, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times continual, but often intermitting fevers ſo familiar, by the unwholſome air, for the reaſons elſewhere ſhewed. If from ſuch an occaſion (as it very often happens) the ſaline principle is carried forth together with the Sulphur, ſuch a ſcorbutick dipoſition as we have above deſcribed, like to fretted or ropy Wine is impreſſed on the Blood. Not only a great tract of humid and vapourous Air, is unwholſome after this manner, but alſo to dwell in houſes ſcituate neer any mariſh, or encompaſſed about with a pond or moat, or in houſes new plaſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with lime, renders perſons obnoxious to this Diſeaſe.</p>

                           <hi>2</hi> Why it follows upon long fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</note>2. A Fever of long continuance, very often induces the Scurvy: the reaſon of which manifeſtly appears from our <hi>hypotheſis;</hi> for from the often, and too much deflagration, of the Blood the Spirits are very much waſted, and like liquor that becomes poor and liveleſs; by its burning, a great plenty of the more pure Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur evaporates, and in the mean time what is left of it, aſſociating to it ſelf the Salt, carrying it up, is wont to cauſe the <hi>Craſis</hi> of the Blood to become planely morbid and ſcorbutick. It is to be obſerved, after a long Fever, by reaſon of the Spirit and Sulphurs to much exhaling and very much of the Salt being for a long time concocted with the remaining Sulphurs, that the Blood becomes very ſalt, and as it were lixivial, ſo indeed that from thence, it is ſcarcely enough inkindled in the heart to perform the circulation: ſuch a diſpoſition of the Blood is not to be reſtored, but by a long time, and is very difficultly hindred from running into the Scurvy. Not only after fevers, but alſo after other chronical diſeaſes, evilly cured, the Scurvy is induced, and that for a double reaſon or means of affecting, to wit, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Blood is changed by the preſent diſeaſe towards a ſcorbutick diſpoſition, or becauſe the diſeaſe hinders the ſick for a great while, from any exerciſe, or motion, and from thence they are inclined, by a long Idleneſs and ſitting ſtill; to the Scurvy. The firſt is diſcerned in Melancholy, when by the depreſſion of the Spirit, and the Salt being carried out into a <hi>fluor,</hi> the Blood turns to a Sourneſs. This kind of <hi>Craſis,</hi> the Sulphur afterwards aſſociating with the Salt, and both of them being carried forth, eaſily paſſes into the Scurvy. The Hypochondriack Affection is ſo much of kin to the Scurvy, that it very often takes it for a Companion: for the melancholy feculencies, which only after the nature of that affect pollutes the Blood, afterwards perverts its <hi>Craſis,</hi> and renders it ſcorbutick: in like manner the Jaundice and Dropſie which at firſt only infects the Blood by an impure and incongruous Mixture, after a long ſtay, quite changes its Temperament. 2. Many other Diſeaſes accidentally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Scurvy for as much as the ſick are hindred from any kind of Labour or Exerciſe; ſo that their blood is very little eventilated, but retained, like Wine a long time upon its lees, looſes its <hi>Craſis</hi> or Temperament, and is liable to the inordinations of the Salt, and Sulphur. After this manner the Palſie, <hi>Lumbago,</hi> or feebleneſs of the Loins, the fracture of Bones, Ulcers, Wounds long time in curing, render Men obnoxious to the Scurvy.</p>

                           <hi>3.</hi> How it is contracted by Succeſſion.</note> ſo as the contagion of the Diſeaſe being derived to Children from their Parents, without any other external or internal cauſes, produces infected fruits exactly like the nature of the ſcorbutick Affection: So have I known Children ſprung from ſickly Parents, to have been af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with wandring pains in their Limbs, an eruption of Spots, an eroſion and rotteneſs of the Gums and Teeth. Beſides it is obſerved, the Children of Parents touched with the venereal Diſeaſe, to be obnoxious to moſt grievous ſymptoms, like to the ſcorbutick Affection. The reaſon of theſe ſorts of affections ſeems to conſiſt in this, for that the filthy taint being impreſſed on the genital humour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes like empoyſoned ferment, which although it for a long time lies hid, being involved with other Particles, at laſt exerts its power and raiſes up the ſymbolick Elements of Sulphur and Salt in the Blood or nervous Juice, and by carrying them above the reſt of the Particles, inclines to the ſcorbutick taint.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. By the ſame reaſon and means of affecting,<note place="margin">How by Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> the Scurvy is propagated by conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, <hi>viz.</hi> the Effluvia's proceeding from an infected Body, and entring into the Pores of one that is near or inſpired by the Breath, ferment either the Blood or the nervous Juice, or both of them together: and ſo by carrying up the ſpirituous-ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, and ſulphureous Particles, pervert the Temperament or <hi>Craſis</hi> of the Liquor, according to their nature.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The cauſes of the Scurvy hitherto cited, reſpect more immediately the bloddy Maſs, and ſhew the diſeaſe to begin from its <hi>latex,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">How the <hi>Viſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> and the firſt ways are in fault.</note> without any great fault in the firſt paſſages. But leſt we ſhould think this Region, to which ſome attribute all the fault; to be wholly free; it ſeems to be determined according to the judgment of others, that the rudiments of the Scurvy is alſo ſometimes conceived within the <hi>Viſcera</hi> of Concoction, and from thence traduced into the Blood: For when it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens from the Chyle, being for a long time vitiated, that the nutricious Juice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes incongruous, and is ſtuffed with Particles of enormous Salts and Sulphurs, which it carries to the bloody Maſs; there is a neceſſity that its <hi>Craſis</hi> will at length be changed, and perverted according to the nature of the matter, by which it is conſtantly and daily ſupplied. Wherefore it is obſerved, that thoſe who eat much of ſalt or ſmoke-dryed Meats, and drink much Wine and ſtrong Waters, by which means Salt and ſulphureous Particles are violently carried into the Blood, are found to be very much obnoxious to the Scurvy: Beſides thoſe who feed much on Swines fleſh or Fiſh, although freſh, but eſpecially on Shell-fiſh, for that theſe Aliments have in them plenty of rank Sulphur and Salt (as may be gathered by the extreme ſtink of their putrefaction) are very apt to fall into the Scurvy, and which is more, ſometimes into the Leproſie. On the contrary, they are not ſo incident to this Diſeaſe, who eat milk meats, raw and unripe fruits, freſh Cheeſe and other abſurd things, which heap up in the Ventricle a great quantity of Phlegm; neither is the Juice nouriſhing the Scurvy, produced from depraved or ill digeſted meats; but ſometimes Aliments fit or convenient enough turn into a morbiſick matter by the fault of the <hi>Viſcera;</hi> which indeed happens not always by the fault of the Liver or Spleen, as ſome have thought, for theſe have no buſineſs with the Chyle, but the Stomach it ſelf being endued with an extraneous ferment, perverts every thing that is put into it, and changes it ſometimes into a ſour, ſometimes into a Salt or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triolick pulp, and it is very likely alſo that the incongruous Juice from the Pancrace, or the cholidical paſſage, may be mixed with the Chyle, and imbue it with an hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogeneous tincture. We do not deny but that the Spleen and the Liver do not ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom contribute to the production of the Scurvy, but yet not the Chyle but more immediately the Blood ſuffers for their faults when the Liver is obſtructed; ſo that the aduſt recrements of the Blood are but little or ſmally ſeparated, by reaſon that its Maſs being more feculent, becomes too luxuriant with the particles of Salt and Sulphur concocted together. As to what relates to the Spleen, it is not altogether undeſervedly, that ſo many complaints are exhibited againſt it, as to the production of the Scurvy: For as the office of this Bowel (as we have before ſhewn) conſiſts in this, that it doth receive and ſeparate both the atrabilary or melancholy feculen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Blood, which conſiſt in a fixed Salt and Earth, and alſo that it digeſts the ſame by a further concoction into a ferment, to be mingled again with the Blood: If then at any time the Spleen does not rightly perform theſe its Offices, the maſs of Blood is wont to be infected in a double reſpect: to wit, either becauſe the atra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilary or melancholy faeculencies are not wholly received by the Spleen being
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40331:211"/> obſtructed or debilitated; or becauſe being received, the ſame are perverted into an unfitting and corruptive ferment of the Blood: After this manner and ſome times after that, the ſanguinious Maſs becomes evilly diſpoſed, and not rarely by this only occaſion, or by the acceſſion of other cauſes, degenerates into a ſcorbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick diſpoſition: And indeed from ſuch a foregoing cauſe, we have formerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the hypocondriack affection to ariſe, to which truly the Scurvy (as even now we hinted) is ſo near a kin, that it moſt often is a companion with it, or follows hard after it. But it plainly appears by the obſervation before cited, that the Scurvy does not always and only ariſe from the fault of the Spleen: For ſome time paſt there was a noble Gentleman, who for many years had laboured under a ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butick affection, accompanied with very many and grievouſly horrid Symptoms; The Phyſicians whilſt they had this Gentleman in cure, concluded his ſickneſs to be contracted by the fault of the Spleen; and all thoſe heavy evils to come upon him for the ſake of that Bowel: At laſt after being afflicted almoſt with continual pains, for the ſpace of ten years, and alſo with the <hi>Paralyſis</hi> and miſerable Convulſions, waſting away, he died with a Conſumption. The Corps being opened it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſenſe, that the Spleen ſo evilly defamed was free from all fault; for this inward was very laudable in figure, magnitude, ſubſtance, and colour, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any tumor or obſtruction: Beſides the ſanguiferous Veſſels being opened and freed from their ſtuffings, the nervous Fibres appear'd firm enough, and the Blood contained within the pores of the Spleen, free from corruption.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Wherefore ſadneſs and immoderate Studies beget the Scurvy.</note>Among the cauſes of the Scurvy, that are wont to be derived from the inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the <hi>non</hi>-naturals, we may here deſervedly place ſadneſs, for it is every where obſerved, that men through ſome occaſion ſtruck with ſorrow, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining for a long time ſad, do become ſcorbutick. The reaſon of which ſeems to be this, great ſadneſs immediately affecting the inferior or bodily Soul, compells inwardly both its parts, to wit, the ſenſitive and the vital, ſtraitens their <hi>Syſtaſes</hi> or conſtitutions, inhibiting their wonted expanſions, and draws them into a leſſer ſpace. Hence the Animal Spirits being hindred from their due expanſion, remit their Oeconomy, wherefore the Blood repeating its Circuits in a leſſer compaſs, is apt to be heaped up about the boſom of the heart, and there to ſtagnate for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, when the Spirits of either Government, <hi>viz.</hi> either animal or vital are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and the Blood and nervous Juice begin to be altered in their complections, either of them by degrees loſing their vigor, turns from a generous Liquor to one ſour and liveleſs: Beſides the <hi>Viſcera</hi> of Concoction being denyed the wonted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux of Spirits, perform very untowardly their Offices. Hence from the Chyle not rightly concocted, or being depraved in its coction, the nutritious Juice being ſtuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed with feculencies, becomes vitious; and is poured on the bloody Maſs, whereby it more perverts its <hi>Craſis,</hi> and cauſes it eaſily to paſs into a ſcorbutick diſpoſition. Moreover for this reaſon, immoderate and too ſerious ſtudies, and the continual intention of the mind, for as much as from hence the Spirits being depreſſed, and the offices of the <hi>Viſcera</hi> ſubverted, the chief <hi>Craſis</hi> of the humours altered for the worſe, they often acquire a ſcorbutick taint: To which we may add, that both ſad and ſtudious perſons, for the moſt part lead a ſolitary life; for which cauſe, both the Blood and nervous Juice, as water wanting motion contracts mud, is wont to be vitiated and ready to fall into a ſcorbutick corruption.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The ſcorbutick taint is derived from the Blood to the Brain and nervous ſtock.</note>Theſe are, if not all the procatartick or more remote cauſes of the Scurvy, yet at leaſt the chief of them which affix its taint on the Blood; there will not need any other Aetiology, to ſhew how it is derived from the hurtful Blood into the nervous Juice, for the Blood by its accuſtomed rite and law of circulation, diſtils a portion of its ſpirituous Liquor into the Brain: But as we have before ſhewn, from the Blood depauperated a thin <hi>latex,</hi> and from that a ſharp liquor and ſalt withal, is drawn off after the manner of ſalts when they are diſtilled: Alſo beſides from the feculent Blood, and as it were, muddy heterogeneous Particles, infeſting the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Kingdom, are brought forth; which notwithſtanding are not eaſily admitted into a firm and ſound Brain.

                     <p>FRom the cauſes of the Scurvy hitherto deſcribed,<note place="margin">The differences of the Scurvy.</note> it will be eaſie to aſſign the differences of this Diſeaſe: For in the firſt place; this affection may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed according to the twofold Region of the conjunct Cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the Blood and the nervous Liquor, for that it is either of this or that Kingdom chiefly, and is more deeply rooted now in the Blood, now in the nervous Juice. Secondly, according to the double taint of the Blood affected, to wit, as that ſhall be either ſulphureous-ſaline, or ſaline-ſulphureous, it ſhall alſo ſignifie the Scurvy by divers Names, or it ſhall be called according to the vulgar appellations, either bilous or hotter, ſhewing it ſelf in ſpots or whelks, and other more apparent ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms; or Melancholy, whoſe poyſon lying hid, as it were covered with aſhes; is known rather by the intrinſick hurt of the faculties, than by outward eruptions. Thirdly, according to the Original and manner of invaſion of the Diſeaſe, to wit, for as much as it is received either by contagion, or that it ariſes through an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>procatarxis</hi> or remote cauſe; alſo according to its various ſtate, it is many ways diſtinguiſhed, and is either beginning, more perfect, or deſperate, and requires di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers manner of Indications as to the Cure, of which we ſhall treat more largely hereafter. In the mean time, it is our buſineſs to recite the ſigns and ſymptoms of the Scurvy, and to add the cauſes of them, and after what manner they happen.</p>
                     <p>The Signs by which Prognoſticks or <hi>Indicia</hi> of the Scurvy are taken,<note place="margin">Signs and Sy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms.</note> are either extrinſick, to wit, certain accidents and circumſtances, which till the more certain notes of the Diſeaſe appear, give a ſuſpicion of it: So we may deſervedly think, any one having a very ſickly diſpoſition, to have contracted ſome taint of the Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, if he be ſprung from ſcorbutick Parents, or if he have long converſed with a Wife, or Companions affected with it; or if he live near the Sea Coaſt or marſhy or otherways unwholeſom places, or if he ſhould have had before a long Fever or other Chronical Diſeaſes, or if he ſhall be ſenſible of help by anti-ſcorbutick Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and that ſuch ill diſpoſition be without a Fever, or certain ſigns of any other Diſeaſe. Or Secondly, the ſigns of this Diſeaſe are preſent affects and ſymptoms, to wit, inherent to the ſick body; which ſort as they are manifold, are wont to be variouſly diſtributed, and reduced into certain Claſſes; that is to ſay, for as much as they are proper to the Scurvy, or common to it with other diſeaſes, alſo for that they are excited, either about the beginning or in the increaſe of the Diſeaſe, or in its worſt ſtate or condition. Further, they are diſtinguiſhed according as they ſhall be excited in the various parts of the Body internal or external, alſo for as much as they may happen either in the Head, Breaſt, the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> or about the Members or habit of the Body: By this way we have already recounted the ſcorbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical ſymptoms. But they may be aptly enough diſtributed according as they ariſe, either by reaſon of their taint, being fixed chiefly in the Blood, or by reaſon of the faults of the nervous Juice, or by reaſon of the congreſſion, or as it were conjunct influences of either humour becoming enormous. We ſhall as much as we can, inſiſt on this method, in reciting and unfolding the ſigns and ſymptoms of the Scurvy, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in the mean time, very many affections which ſeem to proceed from the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular fault of this or that humour, procure ſome fault of the other humour, to be alſo a part of the cauſe: As to what relates to the praeternatural affections of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40331:212"/> firſt paſſages, and the <hi>Viſcera</hi> in the Scurvy, although they ſometimes proceed from errors in living, yet moſt often the ſickneſſes of theſe parts becoming indeed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent ariſe by reaſon of the Blood or nervous Juice, as ſhall be declared here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after in its proper place. In the mean time, we will ſhew at once how the chief ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms of the Scurvy proceed from the fault of this or that humour, or conjunctly from both.</p>

                           <hi>1.</hi> What kind of Affections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe by reaſon of the ſcorbutick Dyſcraſie of the Blood.</note>1. When as the Blood is very much infected with a ſcorbutick taint, evil ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms follow for three chief Reaſons, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Becauſe its Liquor being depaupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, wants its wonted vigor; ſo that it can neither be inkindled in the heart freely, nor be circulated lively and equally: For which Reaſon, a dejection, and as it were a falling down of the whole Soul, Sadneſs, Anxiety, difficultneſs of Breathing, a ſtraitneſs of the Breaſt, intermitting Pulſe, frequent Swoonings, and inordinate ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions of Heat and Cold follow. 2. The Blood abounding with feculencies, pours all about its Recrements on the parts which it waſhes: Wherefore Spots outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Pimples, Whelks, Puſtles, and Ulcers are excited. Hence alſo, Catarrhs, the Dropſie, a ſwelling of the Members, Ulcers of the Gums, Vomitings, Lasks, Fluxes, great Spitting, Sweats, a lixivial Urine, or filled with Contents, as alſo tumors of the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> or obſtructions do not ſeldom follow. 3. A poor and fecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Blood ſupplies the Brain and nervous ſtock with but a vicious Liquor; and ſo by the means of thoſe Parts it communicates its faults: Beſides, a depraved Blood does not afford preſently a <hi>Copula</hi> or joynting to the Spirits, every where abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within the Fibres, convenient enough exploſive for the acts of the locomotive faculty, from whence a ſpontaneous laſſitude, or wearineſs, and impotency to the moving of the parts proceed.</p>

In the Scurvy, the moiſtning juice of the Brain and nervous ſtock, after it is infected with the filthy taint, offends in a treble reſpect. 1. For as much as it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines from a noble and ſpirituous, into a poor and thin Juice, from whence a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guor and enervation of the whole Body, and in ſome part alſo an Atrophy proceeds. 2. For as much as this Liquor is changed from a ſpirituous-ſaline, into a four, acetous Juice, from whence melancholy and fear, a failing of Spirits, and a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion from their wonted vigor, and alſo almoſt continual griefs and irritations of the nervous parts, and a crackling of the Bones are induced. 3. For that this Liquor is ſtuffed with heterogeneous Particles, and infeſting the animal Regimin, Convulſions, Spaſms, or Cramps, Palſies, Vertigo's, ſoporiferous Affections, or pertinacious Watchings, at laſt Fooliſhneſs, or Moping, or Madneſs ariſe.</p>

In a more heavy and inveterate Scurvy, the recrements of the Blood and nervous juice, being depoſited together in divers parts, for as much as they are endued with ſaline Particles, which are of a divers nature, they encounter one with another; and by a mutual ſtriving and efferveſcency, produce moſt horrible Symptoms. From hence ariſe intollerable dolors, chiefly at night, wandring pains in the Joynts, Rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſms, and other affections of this kind. After this manner, from the double fountain of the ſcorbutick taint, very many Rivulets of evil affections running every where in all parts of the whole Body, create griefs.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That yet a more full knowledge may appear, it will not be from the matter, to recount each of the aforeſaid Symptoms, and the reaſons of every one of them, and how they come to paſs particularly to deliver.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <note place="margin">The cauſe of the Symptoms un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded.</note>1. The firſt ſign of the Scurvy, by which oftentimes a ſuſpicion of the beginning of this Diſeaſe is given, is a ſpontaneous wearineſs, to which are added impotencies as to motion, alſo a debility of the Thighs, and as it were a ſenſe of weight or hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs. Theſe Symptoms are wont to ariſe about the beginning of this Diſeaſe, and are derived rather from the fault of the Blood,<note place="margin">Spontaneous wearineſs.</note> than of the nervous Liquor, which is as yet ſcarcely infected: But this may be done in a double reſpect, <hi>viz.</hi> in the firſt place, for as much as the Blood being made impure, flings out ſerous feculencies in its circulation, and inſinuates them into the pores and paſſages of the Muſcles, wherewith they are ſtuffed and loaden, ſo that the Spirits being hindred and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, they perform not freely enough nor lively their locomotive exploſions: Beſides, the parts being loaded as it were with a certain Burthen, they are not eaſily and readily moved as formerly. 2. From a vicious Blood, the exploſive <hi>Copula</hi> of the animal Spirit becomes degenerate and weak, wherefore they neither readily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh, or nimbly perform the local motions: We believe in an inveterate Scurvy the impotency as to motion to ariſe alſo from depravation of the nervous juice, and from the want of Spirits.</p>

Difficult breathing and a ſhortneſs of breath upon any motion,<note place="margin">Difficult Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> is a familiar ſymptom of the Scurvy, of which as there are wont to be two cauſes, it depends now upon one now upon the other, and ſometimes on both together. The ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butick <hi>Dyſpnoea</hi> or ſhortneſs of breath, if it be very frequent and almoſt conſtant, comes from the very poor, and as it were, liveleſs ſtate of the Blood, whereby it is indeed apt to ſtagnate, and not to be eaſily inkindled in the Heart: wherefore from any motion, as the Muſcles urge the ſanguiferous Veſſels, by compreſſing every where their contained liquor, the Blood ruſhes ſomewhat more plentifully into the boſom of the heart, which when it is not there preſently inkindled, and carried forth of doors, it lies heavy at the heart, and threatens a decay of the vital fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: Therefore the Lungs that they may bring help, are moved more ſwiftly, that the Blood may be drawn forth quickly, and ſo for this end, to wit, the circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the liveleſs Blood, and of it ſelf almoſt immoveable, the often and ſhort breathing is cauſed. In this caſe, with laborious breathing there is alſo a quick and ſmall Pulſe. 2. Sometimes the ſcorbutick <hi>Diſpnoea</hi> or ſhort breathing proceeds from the fault of the nervous ſtock, for after the morbid or filthy taint has occupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Brain and its appendices, the heterogeneous Particles ſent from the <hi>Encepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> as they are of kin to other nerves; ſo alſo to other Spirits, to wit, thoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to the motion of the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> and the Muſcles of the Breaſt, come to the Brain; and ſo according as thoſe Nerves are either inhibited or perverted from performing rightly their offices, a difficult reſpiration is produced of a various kind, and is for the moſt part either Paralytick or Convulſive: For the morbifick Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles entring into the nervous ſtock, and about their foldings or extremities being more plentifully heaped up; are fixed with plenty of Spirits. Hence it ſometimes happens from ſuch a cohaeſion of Particles, (if perhaps they be Narcotick) that the Spirits inhabiting thoſe Nerves, are every where bound and hindred from their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned actions: Whence reſpiration being hindred, other Spirits the gueſts of Nerves yet free, that they may perform the common task by their own ſtrength, are very much ſtirred up, and ſo as much as they may, they cauſe a more frequent and laborious reſpiration. But whenever the Spirits flowing within certain Nerves, for the office of reſpiration, are affected with an heterogeneous, exploſive, or ſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modick <hi>Copula</hi> or joynting of the ends of the Muſcles, for the ſake of whoſe preſſing out, when they are excited through plenitude or for other occaſions, they run into convulſive motions: And from thence the Lungs are detained with laborious and often repeated turns, now of <hi>Syſtoles</hi> now of <hi>Diaſtoles,</hi> like to aſthmatick Parox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yſms. In theſe caſes, ſometimes the Nerves of the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> ſometimes the Pneumonick, and thoſe abſolving the motion of the Breaſt, alſo ſometimes perhaps thoſe embracing the <hi>Bronchia,</hi> ſometimes theſe, ſometimes thoſe apart from the reſt, are ſtupefied or obnoxious to cramplike affections, and for that reaſon the various differences and ways of the anomal or unequal reſpiration occur: Some kinds and examples of which we may add hereafter. I know ſome aſcribe the cauſes of the aforeſaid Symptoms to the Vapours elevated from the Ventricle and its Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, whoſe opinion in another place we have deſervedly rejected, with reaſons ſhewn to the contraay. <hi>Eugalenus, Horſtius,</hi> and <hi>Sennertus,</hi> whom others follow, deduce the cauſe of the ſcorbutick <hi>Dyſpnoea</hi> or purſineſs, from the <hi>Viſcera</hi> of the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er belly, being inflated or tumefied, and by that means preſſing the Cawl, as it uſes to come to paſs in Hydropicks, and women big with Child. But I cannot aſſent to this opinion, becauſe this ſymptom does not ſeldom happen to thoſe, whoſe Belly and <hi>Hypocondria</hi> are ſoft enough, and who have the ſinking below the Ribs, and the ſpace for the motion of the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> free enough, as I have often found upon examination. But, that difficult reſpiration fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s upon Hypochondriacks, and ſometimes alſo upon Scorbuticks, upon the perturbation of the Spleen, the reaſon is, becauſe the ſplenick Nerves communicate with the pneumonick: Therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed when either of them are beſet with the morbid, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſpaſmodick matter, and the ſame being moved in either of them, ſtirring up Cramps; it draws the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers into a conſent of affection, as I have already manifeſtly declared, diſcourſing of the hypochondriack paſſions: In all difficult reſpiration excited by reaſon of the fault of the nervous ſtock, the Pulſe though for the moſt part ſtrong enough, yet becomes quicker than it ought to be, and ſometimes intermitting.</p>
                     <p>A ſtraitneſs of the Breaſt heavily infeſts ſome ſcorbutick perſons,<note place="margin">A ſtraitneſs of the Breaſt.</note> which kind of ſymptom hath joyned with it a difficult reſpiration, and commonly is aſcribed to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40331:213"/> the ſame Cauſe, to wit, from the compreſſion of the Caul by the elevated <hi>Viſcera:</hi> But yet though the Breaſt be ſometimes by that means ſtraitned, that thoſe purſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected can hardly draw their breath, but that the taking in of the breath ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates in the midſt of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> yet ſometimes on the contrary, they draw in the Breath too deeply, ſo that they breath it out again hardly and difficultly; which certainly by no means ought to be attributed to the inequalities of the inferior <hi>Viſcera</hi> in the <hi>Diaphragma;</hi> but either to the undue accenſion of the Blood in the Heart, or rather to the preternatural affection of the Nerves, ſerving for reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: By the like reaſon alſo the cauſe of more difficult inſpiration or taking in the Breath, is deduced from the ſame fountain, <hi>viz.</hi> in either caſe the Nerves ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for the drawing in and thruſting out the Breath, for that they are poſſeſſed with a morbifick matter, and that either Narcotick or Spaſmodick, they perform in the executing their proper Offices either more or leſs than they need to do. But ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſcorbutick Perſons are troubled with a ſtraitneſs of Breaſt, without the breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much hindred; ſo that they feel the compaſs of the <hi>Thorax</hi> to be more ſtrictly drawn together, and to be contracted into a narrower ſpace: In the mean time, thoſe ſo affected complain rather of the anxiety of the heart, than of any hindrance of the motion of the Lungs: The cauſe of this ſeems to be, that the Membranes inveſting the <hi>Praecordia;</hi> for as much as being too much irrigated with a ſerous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, together with the nervous, become more contracted like wet Leather: So that their Fibres being irritated, wrinkle themſelves too much into ſhort Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions or Spaſms, and from thence they force the containing parts to be ſtraitned: Beſides, this kind of ſtraitning of the <hi>Praecordia</hi> follows in ſome part the motion of the Heart it ſelf: For whilſt the Blood is made poorer, it does not leap forth ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough from the boſom of the Heart, nor flames out openly into the Lungs. Wherefore theſe need the leſs to be dilated or expanded, but rather that they may anſwer to the circulation of the Blood, performed in a leſſer compaſs, and exactly quadrate to the inveſting Membranes, and to the nervous Fibres deſtinated to their motion, they are regulated according to the weak limits of expanſions: Wherefore this conſtriction of the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> as I have obſerved in very many, is wont to be ſuddenly remitted and intended, by reaſon of the occaſions of Joy and Sadneſs, even as the Blood leaps out more plentifully or more ſparingly from the boſom, of the Heart, the greater or the leſſer ſpace is proportionated to its Circulation.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Inordinate Pulſe.</note>4. An unequal and an intermitting Pulſe, alſo frequent ſwoonings and fear of the ſame, very often happen in the more grievous Scurvy, the ſame reaſon of which as of unequal breathing, is aſcribed deſervedly, now to the undue accenſion of the blood in the Heart, and now to the inordination of the nervous ſtock. The Blood being made more ſaltiſh, and beſides much ſtuffed with ſcorbutick feculencies, is but unequally and brokenly inkindled, like the oyl of a Lamp imbued with Salt and muddy filths: Wherefore from hence an irregular Pulſe, with a waſting of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſpirits in the Brain is ſtirred up. Moreover, when the cardiack Nerves are alſo beſet round with a morbifick matter, ſo that the influx of the animal Spirits, by which the motion of the heart is continued, is not performed in a juſt dimenſion and equal manner, by that means it happens that the motion of the heart is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what hindred, and its reciprocations variouſly diſturbed; an inequal or intermitting Pulſe, and a ſmall and weak ſeems to proceed from the dyſcraſie of the Blood, but if it be great and ſtrong enough, from the fault of the animal function.</p>

In the mean time, whilſt the whole bulk of the heart is agitated by that means, it does often rightly perform the proper motions of <hi>Syſtole</hi> and <hi>Diaſtole,</hi> as I have obſerved in many, who with ſuch a ſhaking of the heart have had an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and laudable Pulſe.</p>

Erratick Fevers, alſo ſudden ſuffuſions of heat and cold in ſeveral parts of the Body, uſe to come upon an inveterate Scurvy: The reaſon of the former is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the extraneous matter being often carried to the Blood with the nutritious Juice, for that alſo the alible Juice it ſelf is made degenerous, becauſe it is not rightly
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40331:213"/> mixed with the Blood, they ſtir up its extemporany efferveſcencies. In the mean time, a Fever obſerving a regular type, for that cauſe excited rarely happens to Scorbuticks, becauſe the ſalſuginous Blood, although it be taken with a feveriſh burning, does not burn long nor much, at leaſt not equally: As to the ſudden ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions of heat and cold, they indeed ſeem to be inferred ſomewhat by reaſon of the affection of the nervous ſtock; for that the Nerves and Branches and nervous ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours, do diverſly embrace and compaſs about the ſanguiferous Veſſels in moſt parts of the Body, perhaps for that uſe, that the courſe of the Blood might be urged and reſtrained, as it were with Goads and Bridles, according to the force of the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and other exigencies of Nature, it is very likely that when the oeconomy of the animal Kingdom is perverted by the ſcorbutick taint, that moſt of the Nerves and Fibres and their Appendices, being ſtretched out here and there; do every where run into ſpaſms or convulſive motions, and alſo by reaſon of their hurt, the irregularity of the Arteries and Veins are contracted: So that the Blood is compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into theſe parts more than it ought, and is too much eſtranged from them, from whence theſe kind of inordinations of heat and cold proceed.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Plentiful Sweats chiefly at night,<note place="margin">Nightly Sweats.</note> are wont to be very troubleſome to ſome ſcorbuticks, the reaſon of which is, that as the nutritious Juice being daily brought into the maſs of Blood, by reaſon of the dyſcraſie or evil diſpoſition of this, and the impurity and filth of that is not aſſimulated; but being rejected of the Blood is ſent away under the form of Sweat. But that the nutritious Juice in the time of its aſſimilating, becoming degenerate; does not produce an intermitting Fever after its manner, the cauſe is the ſalſuginous intemperature of the Blood, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore becomes leſs able for periodick deflagrations: this ſort of immoderate ſweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing happens chiefly in the Scurvy, following upon a long Fever or other Chronical Dyſcraſies, where the nutritious Liquor is perverted, rather by the default of the aſſimilating Blood, than of the concocting <hi>Viſcera.</hi>

                     <p n="8">8. In a more certain Scurvy, as in other Diſeaſes, we conſult the Urinal:<note place="margin">Lixivial Urine.</note> For if the Urine appears intenſly red, and as it were lixivial without a Fever or the Jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, we undoubtedly pronounce this a ſign of that Diſeaſe: For whilſt the ſerous <hi>Latex</hi> is circulated for ſome time with the ſoluted Salt and Sulphur, the ſaline and ſulphureous Particles being inconcocted in the ſame, beſtow on it a very deep and as it were lixivial tincture: Alſo that ſuch Urine abounds very much with contents, which, the ſtale being cold, precipitate to the bottom, it altogether owes it to the Particles of the degenerate nutritious Juice, ſnatched away with the <hi>Serum.</hi> But yet the Urines of the ſcorbutick perſons often vary, for ſometimes they appear of a Citron colour, with a Cream ſwimming in it or fixed to the ſides of the Glaſs, from whence an <hi>indicium</hi> is taken, that the Blood doth abound with ſaline rather than ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous Particles: Indeed if ſuch an Urine be exhaled at the fire, the ſaline reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence will remain in almoſt the double quantity of the Liquor. Moreover, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Urines of the Sick are changed from this or that ſtate to the contrary, ſo that what was to day red or of a Citron colour; to morrow is made limpid, clear, and thin, and in abundance: Which kind of Piſs, as it appears, was not circulated long with the Blood (becauſe it hath received no tincture from it) we judge to come to paſs from the watry recrements of the Blood and nervous juice, contained partly within the Lymphaeducts, and partly depoſited within the Pores and paſſages of the ſolid parts, which when they are gathered together to a fulneſs, every where run forth of their Receptacles with the riſing flood, and ruſhing into the bloody Maſs, are from thence ſent away preſently by the Reins.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. There follows upon this Diſeaſe being grown very grievous,<note place="margin">A plentiful ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and ulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Affections of the Mouth.</note> a plentiful ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and for the moſt part a bloodineſs of the Gums, and then a looſeneſs of them and at length a putrefaction, which is wont to be accompanied with an Eroſion, Looſeneſs, or falling out of the Teeth, and with a ſtinking Breath: That the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of which may the better appear, in the firſt place, you are to be advertiſed, that there are ordained about the peculiar parts of the mouth, certain Pipes or paſſages, to wit, ſalival, by which the ſerous humours are plentifully ſent forth: Theſe ariſing from various Glandula's, to wit, the <hi>Parotides</hi> being in the Weſand or Throat, the Maxillar for thoſe belonging to the Jaws, and thoſe under the Tongue for the moſt part terminate about the Gums or near them: The conſtant and ordinary Office of theſe, is to lay up the Spittle for ſome neceſſary uſes in the Cavity of the mouth. Beſides, it is obſerved, that the ſuperfluous humours, yea the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40331:214"/> more thick and vicious, are perhaps ſent away forth adoors by this way, rather than ſeparated from the Blood as by Urine, Sweat, and otherways. Quickſilver prepared with Salts and taken inwardly, or the Body anointed with it, is minutely diſſolved by the ſaline Particles of our Body, and being with them involved, mixes it ſelf moſt deeply: Theſe kind of Concretions of Salts and Mercury, being diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thorow all the humours, and into all the parts of the whole Body, as Nature endeavours to expel the trouble they afford; the beſt and indeed moſt eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms their execution, by theſe emunctories of the Mouth: For the Blood, and perhaps in ſome part the nervous Liquor being burthened with thoſe mercurial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaline Recrements, endeavour by every way to ſhake them off; which however, when they are more thick and fixed, than that they can be exhaled or diſtilled forth by ſweat, or ſent away, being precipitated by the ferment of the Reins through the Urine; they are ſometimes breaking thorow the little mouths of the Arteries, inſerted in the Inteſtines, in ſome part excluded by the Belly: But yet the particles of this Medicine being involved with the <hi>Serum,</hi> and moſt readily depoſited in the aforeſaid Glandula's, and in others belonging to the Mouth and Throat, ſlow out by ſalivation more plentifully excited; by which effluxion it happens that the Gums and other parts of the Mouth are ulcerated, and the Teeth are looſened with a ſtinking of the Mouth. But this kind of ſalivation ſometimes ſucceeds of its own accord, inſtead of a <hi>Criſis</hi> without <hi>Mercury,</hi> in the declination of ill judged Fevers, and the humour to be excerned, ſweating forth not only from the more open holes of the ſalival paſſages, but alſo from the little mouths of the Arteries every where thick planted, daub over the Cavity of the Mouth with a whitiſh ſcurf. The like reaſon as of theſe accidents, may be rendred of theſe ſort of Symptoms in the Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy: For indeed when in a depraved Blood, more and thicker recrements of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normous Salt and Sulphur are gathered together than can be excerned by evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or by Urine or Seige, they are carried to the emunctories of the Mouth; by which the more ſalt purgaments of the Blood are wont to go forth; theſe ſalt things being diluted with the <hi>Serum,</hi> ſweating not only from the ſalival Veſſels, create great ſpitting; but alſo being carried thorow the Arteries, enter into the ſoft and ſpungy fleſh of the Gums, which firſt of all, their pores being filled with an ichorous Blood, ſwell up; but afterwards the ſalt Ichor going forth from the Blood, and being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually excreted, the fleſh of the Gums, by reaſon of the defect of laudable nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, grows flaggy, leaving the Teeth almoſt naked. Further, by a long afflux of matter plainly corroſive, the fleſh of the Gums is eaten away; ſo that the Teeth can hardly ſtand, but grow looſe or fall out of the corrupted Stalls: And by reaſon of the ſaline-ſulphureous Particles, partly of the excreted humour and partly of the putrefying Gums, being continually breathed forth, the filthy ſtinking ſmell of the mouth is excited.</p>

More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, Whelks almoſt of every kind do generally happen not only in the Scurvy, but in many other Diſeaſes, yea if at any time the Blood does immoderately boyl up through any occaſions. But ſpots are portions ſecreted from the Blood and every where forſaken by it; ſo that there is nothing of commerce between them and the circulated Blood, wherefore they increaſe not in bulk, nor ſuppurate, nor eaſily e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaporate. The Citron or darkiſh Spots ſeem to be ſome portions of Choler or

                        <note place="margin">Melancholy.</note>2. In an inveterate Scurvy the nervous Juice declines from a ſpirituous-ſaline diſpoſition towards a ſour one; hence, as we have elſewhere ſhown, Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, a fluctuation of the mind, an often mutation, and inconſtancy of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, proceed: moreover, as the nervous Fibres are perpetually watered by the influx of ſuch an humor, from hence, in ſome part, come the more light Spaſms or Twiches, cramp-like contractures, and wandring Pains. But indeed, the cheifeſt vice of the nervous liquor, is wont to be, that being ſtuffed with filths and faeculencies, it contains heterogeneous particles, and divers ways hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the animal regiment: wherefore happen very often to Scorbuticks hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid and grievous Affections, of which ſort, are the following Symptoms.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <note place="margin">Scorbutick Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.</note>3. Paralytick Affections, <hi>viz.</hi> Impotency, or the reſolution of one or more of the Members, alſo ſtupor, or lack of feeling, and a ſenſe of tingling, or prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, often follow upon a deep and heavy Scurvy: which ſort of Symptoms are not however, for the moſt part, very much fixed and permanent, but ſometimes they ceaſe or remit, and anon are repeated or increaſed. The ſcorbutick Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie is wont to be excited chiefly from three ſorts of cauſes,<note place="margin">From <hi>3.</hi> ſorts of Cauſes.</note> which now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctly now diviſively produce this Diſeaſe. 1. For the Debility, or reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Members happens, becauſe of the nervous Juice being departed, there wants a ſufficient plenty, or ſtock, of the animal Spirits, whereby all the members ſhould be actuated: Hence, the ſick have the locomotive faculty flagging, or weak, as if infeebled by old age, about the thighs, and feet, and ſometimes in other extream parts, to which the influx of the Spirits doth not plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully reach: perhaps afterwards, as greater afflux of the Spirits is carried to the affected Member, and is in the mean time elſe where deficient, the diſeaſe ceaſes, or is transferred to another place. 2. Sometimes the animal Spirits, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they are plentifully and ſufficient enough, in the parts, yet they are infected with Heterogeneous, and as it were narcotick particles, brought along with the nervous Juice, ſo that being as it were bound, and almoſt overwhelmed, they are not able ſufficiently and nimbly enough, to perform their exploſive endeavours, or labors: hence ariſe not only the impotency of the motive faculty, but alſo a certain depravation of the ſenſitive, <hi>viz.</hi> a benummedneſs, and a ſence of ſtinging, tingling or pricking: for that, whilſt the animal Spirits are loaded with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous <hi>Copula,</hi> their irradiation, like the beams of the Sun, paſſing thorow a cloudy air, is performed, but refractedly, and diſturbedly. 3. Although the animal Spirits are diſpenſed in a ſufficient plenty, and are free and clear of any narcotick quality, yet oftentimes their paſſages are obſtructed, ſo that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce between the inflowing Spirits and thoſe implanted within ſome members,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40331:215"/> cannot be performed conveniently; for it ſometimes happens, that the more thick and earthy Particles do enter into the bodies of the Nerves with the moiſtning Juice; which ſo ſtuff the paſſages, about the enfoldings of the Nerves and other nervous windings, with their full burthen, that the irradiation of the Spirits in this or that member is wholly hindred. So I have known ſome, who have had a hand or foot wholly enfeebled or reſolved, whilſt the arm, or thigh, with the reſt of the Body was well.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. From the like cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> ſcorbutick Faeculencies,<note place="margin">Pains, of which there are ſeveral Species.</note> fallen upon the Bodies of the Nerves, Griefs or Pains alſo, which are eſteemed the moſt frequent Symptomes of this Diſeaſe, do in ſome ſort proceed; But as they are of a divers kind, they alſo ariſe ſometimes from other Cauſes. For indeed, the ſcorbutick Pains are either more light, uncertain, and quickly paſſing away, which depend ſometimes upon a <hi>Flatus,</hi> or Wind diſtending the Membranes, and ſometimes on a ſharp or Salt matter, poured forth, now from the Blood, now from the nervous Juice, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the nervous parts; which kind of matter, for that it is improportionate to the nervous Fibres, pulls or hawls them, and irritates them into corrugations or wrinklings and becomes painful: but, for as much as the ſame is quickly waſhed off by the flowing of the <hi>Serum,</hi> or diſſipated by heat, the troubleſom ſenſe brought in from ſuch a cauſe is more eaſily removed. Or in the ſecond place, the ſcorbutick Dolors, are more grievous, very acute, and hard to be moved, which ſort alſo, are either fixed, or determinated to ſome particular place, or wandring transfer the Pain, and that moſt grievous, from one place to another, as may be perceived in a wandring and Scorbutick Gout, and Rheumatiſm, concerning which we ſhall diſcourſe hereafter: In the mean time, fixed Pains and a long time remaining, are wont to be excited in divers parts, but chiefly in the Belly, Loyns Thighs, <hi>Sternum</hi> or Cheſt, and in the Head: It will be worth our labour, brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to deſcribe the Pathologie belonging, to every one of theſe places.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The pain of the belly is ſo familiar to the Scurvy,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>1.</hi> An almoſt continual Pain of the Belly.</note> that according to the German <hi>Idiom,</hi> it ſhould take from thence its name. This Symptom, though in a lighter degree, almoſt continually afflicts ſome ſick perſons, to which is joyned now a looſneſs, and now a high binding up of the Belly: the reaſon of which ſeems to be, for that, when both the Blood and nervous Juice abound with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities, both the Arteries and Nerves carry the plenty of excrementious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter towards the ſink of the Belly, which being fixed about the Coats of the Meſentery, or the Inteſtines, ſtir up conſtant Pains, by a perpetual pulling the nervous Fibres. But beſides there happen to ſome ſcorbutical perſons,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>2.</hi> Pains as it were of the Colick.</note> Paroxyſms or fits of very acute Pains, as it were Colical Affections, which being protracted for many days, yea ſometimes weeks, miſerably torment the ſick: ſo that they think their Bowels to be pulled, and torn to pieces with the grievouſneſs of the Pain: theſe pains are wont hardly to be allaied with any remedies, unleſs with the more generous Opiates; and as ſoon as the virtue of the Hypnoticks is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, they are repeated with their wonted Cruelty, but continuing with a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger fit, very often torments in the Loins and Back are propagated and at length are diffuſed on the members of the whole Body: to this ſort of affection a Palſie does not ſeldom ſucceed. But then in reſpect of the Cauſe of the Scorbutick Colick,<note place="margin">The cauſe of them.</note> it is not probable that it ſhould ariſe from a ſharp matter, depoſited within the Cavities of the Inteſtines, neither from any ſimple humor, however miſchievous it be impacted in their Coats: for this is quickly ſhaken off, or goes into an Ulcer, beſides that is eaſily exterminated by the uſe of Clyſters, or Purges: but indeed, theſe cruell torments of the Belly can come from no other cauſe, than the mutual ſtrivings and efferveſcencies of the Salts (which are of a divers Nature) fighting or ſtrugling together, whereby truly the Nervous Fibres are pulled, and as it were torn aſunder. For we may ſuppoſe, that certain ſour recrements of the nervous Juice, like to vitriolick <hi>Stagmas,</hi> being gathered together about the fold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Meſenterie, or other nervous parts of that region, to which comes a ſerous <hi>Colluvies</hi> from the arterious Blood growing hot, abundantly ſtuffed with the particles of a fixed, and as it were a lixivial Salt, and with thoſe ſwellings up pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces as it were piercing Pains. From hence it may be argued that the mine of the former morbid Stock deſcends from the Head, by the paſſage of the Nerves, into the lower Belly, for that great headaches, alſo the Vertigo and Swimming, or turning round in the Head often praeceed, and not rarely ſucceed this kind of Colick.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40331:216"/> Beſides, it appears that from the Bloody Maſs there is a large ſupply ſent of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of fixed Salt, paſſing as it were by <hi>Deliquium,</hi> or a ſtraining thorow; becauſe the fitt of this Diſeaſe being very urgent, the Urine of the ſick appears of a deep colour, and is very much ſtuffed with Salt, and is as it were lixivial, and oftentimes its ſuperficies is variegated with divers Colours, like the train of a Peacock: But ſo ſoon as the Diſeaſe begins to decline, the Urine is better, and from hence they are wont to aſſume hope and ſigns of growing well. But that this affection of the Belly is often propagated into the Loins, the reaſon is becauſe the nerves of the Loyns and the meſentery intimately communicate, and in very many places are mutually inoculated: wherefore when the dolorifick matter ſuperabounds in the paſſages of theſe, it eaſily paſſes into the neighbour proceſſes of thoſe: But then that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe increaſing, the pains being diffuſed thorow the whole Body, almoſt every Joynt and Member are afflicted, the reaſon is, becauſe when a more plentiful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of the morbid ſeed is begotten in the head, than can be derived to the whole ſtock of the firſt affected Nerves, <hi>viz.</hi> the moving and intercoſtal pair; part of it entering into the Bodies of the other Nerves, and alſo ſpinal Marrow, ſpreads abroad this morbifick mine, participating of acetous Salt into very many parts of the whole Body, which every where by the acceſſion of the fixed Salt, from the bloody Maſs becomes dolorifick: and laſtly, after that the plenty of Spirits is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligated by the incongruous matter, the reſidue after the mutual efferveſcencies of the Humours, being in very many of the Nerves together beſet, and mightily filled or ſtopped up, the waies of Emanation are obſtructed, and their mutual commerce is broken off, ſo that 'tis no wonder if thoſe long Pains end at laſt in a Palſie, not only in the middle of the Belly,<note place="margin">Pains in ſeveral parts of the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen.</hi>
                        </note> where the morbifick cauſe ſeems to ſubſiſt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the foldings of the Meſenterie, but in other places round about, Pains not inferior to the Colick, are wont to ariſe. I know a noble Maid that was obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to moſt cruel Torments, near the <hi>os Pubis,</hi> during about the ſpace of a Month, and were wont to be repeated upon any occaſion, given without any ſuſpition of the Stone, or Ulcer in the urinary Paſſages: which kind of affection I judge to depend upon a morbid matter impacted in the nervous foldings, planted in the <hi>Hypogaſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</hi> Further, it is familiar to ſcorbutical Perſons, to find fits of very cruel Pains, ſometimes in the right, ſometimes in the left <hi>Hypochondria,</hi> and ſometimes about the Region of the Ventricle: the cauſes of which we think to ly hid in the nervous foldings belonging to the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> planted in that place.</p>

                        <note place="margin">In the Loins and Back.</note>2. Scorbutick Pains, are wont ſometimes to infeſt the Loins, and alſo the Region of the Back, now above, now below, without any praevious Affection of the <hi>Abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> or of the Reins. I have known ſeveral keeping their Beds with ſuch a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, perpetually crying out Day and Night, by reaſon of the intollerable tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: The cauſe of this kind of Paſſion may be aſcribed to the acetous Recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the nervous Juice poured on the Membranes, and Tendons of thoſe parts, and ſo ſtirred up into efferveſcency, by the acceſſion of the Sanguinious ſaltiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>

By reaſon of the ſame conjoyning of Salts, affixed on the Membranes, Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> very troubleſom Pains about the region of the Breaſt, and not eaſily to be removed, are often induced; hence the Baſtard pleuriſie is ſo frequent a ſymptom of the Scurvy.

                        <note place="margin">In the Head.</note>4. Hitherto we have recounted the chief kinds of Pains, infeſting the middle parts of the Body. But in the Scurvy there is felt thoſe no leſs troubleſom, in the extream parts, <hi>viz.</hi> the Head, Thighs and Leggs. As to the firſt, Headach is ſo rarely wanting to this Diſeaſe, that many by this effect are ſatisfied chiefly that it is the ſcorbutick Venom; by which they become obnoxious to moſt grievous fits of this evil, and handled for a long time, and oftentimes repeated. The cauſe of this is obvious to every one, that it may be aſcribed to the humours poured on the <hi>Meninx</hi> or Films inwrapping the Brain, which alſo Anatomie hath proved.

                     <p n="5">5. Nor indeed is it any otherwiſe to be determined,<note place="margin">In the Thighs.</note> as to the Pains moſt griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly afflicting the Thighs and Leggs of the ſick, chiefly in the night time: for many labouring with an inveterate Scurvy as ſoon as ever they are warm in their beds, are wont to endure intollerable torments, about the calves of the Leggs, Shins and Thighs, and ſometimes about other parts, ſo that they cry out their fleſh is gnawn, or torn in pieces like the biting of Dogs: Theſe tortures if they leave their Bed, do ſomewhat abate; otherwiſe the afflicted are moſt miſerably tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all Night long: In this caſe there can nothing be more aptly conceived, than the acetous recrements of the nervous Juice, to fall down on the Leggs, as into a place having a great declivity and to be copiouſly affixed to their Membranes, to which whilſt the rejected Salts do come from the Blood notably rarefied and agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, thorough the heat of the Bed, and do ferment with theſe after the manner of Salts, therefore indeed from the mutual ſtriving and efferveſcency of the Par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>cles of divers kinds, the nervous Fibres being pulled and hawled beyond meaſure, run into painful Corrugations, neither do indeed theſe dolorifick Pains ceaſe or remit, till the particles then gathered together, either evaporate or by their mutual wreſtling being brought under are worn out, are quiet from their efferveſcencie; but then within a little ſpace, freſh proviſion of either matter diſpoſes to a new paroxyſm, by reaſon of the mutual efferveſcencie and coalition. Of theſe kind of Salts of a diverſe kind, proceeding from a twofold humour, the wandring Gout, the Rheumatiſm and certain other affections are produced, which we deſervedly impute to the conjunct dyſcraſies, and as it were evil confaederations of the Blood and nervous Juice. Moreover in the ſame Claſs certain ſpecies of ſcorbutick Pains but now handled, ought to be placed; but becauſe they are of kin to other Pain, ariſing from the Sole Vice of the nervous Juice, or of the Blood, therefore we have here joyned together the divers Theories of the dolorifick Affections.</p>
                     <p>As there is a conflux of Symptoms of a divers kind in the Scurvy, ſo there is begotten a manifold morbifick matter, and of a divers nature: <hi>viz.</hi> Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneos particles coming into the Brain and nervous ſtock, with the moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Juice, are ſometimes narcotick, bringing forth the Palſie and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſaline, cauſing Pains, (as we have ſaid) alſo ſometimes they are nitro-ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous and exploſive, from which the ſpaſmodie or cramp-like affections ariſe: but by reaſon of particles of this ſort go together in the Brain, there happen to ſcorbutical perſons, Vertigos, ſwimmings in the head and outragious aſſaults, like the falling ſickneſs: From the like cauſe, poſſeſſing the nervous Stock, proceed convulſive motions, tremblings, ſhakings, and very often horrid contractions in the <hi>Viſcera</hi> and in the Members. We have already ſpoken largely enough of the nature, differences and cauſes of Convulſions. Beſides we have fully deſcribed cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain admirable caſes of this affection, ariſing from the ſcorbutick infection, ſo that it ſeems needleſs to diſcourſe any more of this matter, for it may be eaſily accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated by the hypotheſis before delivered, to all the ſpaſmodick ſymptoms of the Scurvy whatſoever.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Thoſe labouring with an inveterate Scurvy are very obnoxious to a Vertigo:<note place="margin">The Vertigo.</note> Concerning this affection, and alſo of many other Cephalical, we have made ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al diſquiſitions, which may perhaps be ſometimes be made publick. In the mean time we will in one word ſignifie that this Symptom ariſes, for that the animal ſpirits are in ſome meaſure perverted from the wonted ways of their expanſions, to wit, being either hindred on otherways driven from their ſeries, ſtate, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are compelled to break off: this happens to come to paſs as in other caſes, ſo chiefly in the Scurvie eſpecially for two cauſes, either for the one, or the other, or for both together; <hi>viz.</hi> either becauſe the commerce of the Spirits is obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſomewhere, in ſome paſſages and Pores of the brain, being poſſeſſed by ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traneous gueſt, or ſecondly, ſome companies of the Spirits, being burthened with an heterogeneous <hi>Copula,</hi> or joynting are compelled to ſtay behind the reſt, or to go out of their tracts: In this Diſeaſe the liquor indeed inſtilled to the brain from a very impure blood, brings with it very many Faeculencies, by which it can be no otherways, but that the heterogeneous particles ſhould every where ſtuff up
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40331:217"/> the Pores of the Brains and growing to the animal Spirits, oppoſe them or force them into exploſions.</p>
                     <p n="7">
                        <note place="margin">Sleepineſs.</note>7. Almoſt for the like cauſe, ſleepineſs and torpor, or heavineſs frequently hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to Scorbutick perſons, <hi>viz.</hi> for as much as the animal Spirits being burthened with watery or narcotick Particles, and very much oppreſſed, cannot perform rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily their expeditious and quick motions within the Brain very much alſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, neither continue long the acts and exerciſes of their functions, but love to ly down and to indulge themſelves with idleneſs and reſt. Moreover, this ſort of affection ſometimes is ſtirred up by the defect and want of the animal Spirits; for from the Blood very much vitiated and as it were dead, the Brain and nervous Stock is ſupplied but with a thin Liquor, and almoſt lacking of all <hi>Vigor:</hi> From ſuch a <hi>Prophaſis</hi> or occaſion, I have known a Lethargie excited in thoſe about to dy; by which the affected though they ſeemed to indulge themſelves with a continual ſleep, yet being called are wont to know thoſe ſtanding about them, and to anſwer thoſe who ſpeak to them; but the ſtore of the animal Spirits growing weary, they were neither able to wake long nor to attend to diſcourſe. When I have opened ſuch who were overwhelmed with perpetual ſleep, I have found the Brain dry e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough and altogether free from a Dropſie, or ſerous <hi>Colluvies,</hi> with which lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick perſons are wont for the moſt part to be affected.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">And waking.</note>But ſometimes on the contrary, ſome ſcorbutick perſons are moleſted with al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt continual waking. Which kind of Symptom proceeds ſometimes from the affections of the mind, Grief, convulſive Paſſions, fear of Swooning, paſſions of the Heart, and alſo from the perturbations of the Stomach and of other <hi>Viſcera;</hi> for as much as the Spirits being vehemently moved in every part of the ſenſitive Soul, their whole Hypoſtaſis is detained from entering into reſt, or a tranquil condition. For I have known ſome touched with a ſcorbutical Taint, who though they were free from Pains or Spaſms, and alſo clear from any immoderate affection of the mind, have been induced to watchings day and night for many weeks, and oftentimes could get no ſleep, though they had taken ſtrong opiates: In the mean time they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued lively enough and ready to the performance of Labours, without any heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Head, and without any torpor or ſluggiſhneſs of the mind or ſenſes, as if they had wanted no ſleep. The reaſon of this ſeems to be, that ſometimes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the nervous Juice, certain nitro-ſaline Particles of a fierce and unquiet na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, (of which ſort are the effluvias falling from <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> or the ſpirit of nitre) growing to the Spirits, compell them to be perpetually agitated and to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually in motion: for even as Vapors breathing forth from ſtygian Waters, are never altogether fixed or at reſt, ſo the heterogeneous Particles which are of that ſort of Nature, adhering to the Spirits inhabiting the Brain, ſuffer them ſcarce ever to be idle or to indulge ſleep. Theſe are the chief ſymptoms that are wont to be ſtirred up in the animal regimen, by reaſon of the ſcorbutick taint be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impreſſed on the moiſtning liquor of the Brain and Nerves; which with thoſe before mentioned happen by fault of the Blood, degenerating from its right <hi>Craſis.</hi> But as to thoſe great and Herculian Diſeaſes, to wit, the aſſaults of the Apoplexie and the Epilepſie, which ſometimes happen to ſcorbutical Perſons: In theſe caſes the former affection, being as it were married to another more worthy looſes it name, and paſſes into the Pathology of that, as it were into its Progeny, laſtly we will inquire what are the ſymptoms of the Scurvy by reaſon of the conjunct Dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craſies of the Blood and nervous Juice, as it were joyning their alliances in Evil.</p>

                     <p>IN this rank,<note place="margin">The Scorbutick Atrophy.</note> in the firſt place is ſet the ſcorbutick Atrophy or conſumption of the Fleſh: for who labour long with this Diſeaſe often fall into a <hi>Maraſmus</hi> without any ſignal fault of the Lungs, or ſuſpition of a Conſumption or <hi>Phthiſis,</hi> ſo that the Fleſh wholly falls away, and the Skin becoming very flaggy, ſcarce ſticks on the Bones. The cauſe of which ought not only to be attributed to the fault of the Blood degenerating from its right <hi>Craſis</hi> or diſpoſition; for this how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever depraved it be, for the moſt part aſſimilates ſome portion of the nutricious Juice, and beſtows it on the parts to be nouriſhed: but indeed when as the nervous Juice is alſo bad, the nutritive faculty is altogether inhibited; for that by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect or fault of this, the nutriment elaborated by the Blood becomes altogether unprofitable and unfruitful: By what means, as to nutrition, either Liquor, to wit, the Sanguinious and nervous diſcharge themſelves, we have elſe where ſhewn. From that hypotheſis, which ſeems to be built upon ſufficiently probable reaſons, it eaſily follows that the Atrophie familiar to the Scurvy depends from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct irregularities of either nutritive faculty. For as much as the Blood gives only vicious aliment, and that the nervous Liquor fails in the actuating and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milating it, there is a neceſſity for the ſolid parts, being continually defrauded of their food, to wither away.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ſcorbutick Gout, which is very much wandring,<note place="margin">The wandring ſcorbutick Gout,</note> and affects now this Part now that ſucceſſively, now more parts together, and leaps about from one place to another, or from theſe places to thoſe, ſeems to depend upon a double Stock, even as the Colick above deſcribed, but the manner altogether inverted. For indeed it is to be ſuppoſed in this Diſeaſe, that very many heaps of the fixed Salt, from the bloody Maſs are diſpoſed here and there about the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and Joynts as ſo many Neſts: which indeed being hid within ſo many diſtinct Cells, remain as the Eggs of Fiſhes, or as the feminine Seed, to which afterwards the acetous ſour recrements of the nervous Liquor come as the maſculine Seed, and renders them fertil, to wit, in as much as the Salts of a divers nature, being commixed, they greatly ferment or grow hot; and ſo by the mutual wreſtling and agitation of the particles, the Membranes and nervous Fibres being notably hauled, they are carried into dolorifick Corrugations. In truth, it from hence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that the firſt mine of this diſeaſe as alſo of the common Gout, is to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the bloody Maſs, and to be actuated by the Recrements of the nervous Juice, becauſe when the aſſaults of the Pains ariſe in various parts together, or ſucceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Blood ſeems not to grow hot above the meaſure, nor its ſalſaments paſſing by <hi>Deliquium</hi> at that time flow out more plentifully; for that neither the Pulſe becomes quicker nor the Urine lixivial. But in an urgent fit, very often a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Headach, an heavineſs of the Head or Vertigo, inquietude of the Members and often a leaping of the Tendons, which ſort of Symptoms often praecede or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the aſſaults of pains, argue the ſour recrements of the nervous Juice to ſuffer a flux. To this appertains that the acid liquors being drunk up, provoke the gouty Paroxyſms. In the Scurvy indeed either Mine is more plentifully begotten, the neſts of the Gout are longer publiſhed, and the pains in theſe do ſpring ſooner by far: beſides from a very impure Blood, a ſaline or tartarous matter is heaped up not only in the Joynts of the Feet or Thighs, but almoſt every where about the membranes and the interſpaces of the Muſcles, to which alſo an acetous <hi>Copula</hi> or joynting being poured out in many places from the nervous Juice, it becomes fruitful of Pains; then for as much as either Mine conſiſts in a matter leſs thick, and is gathered together in open places, it is either waſhed away in a little time by the <hi>Serum</hi> flowing to it, or it is diſſipated by heat, or elſe being ſucked again by the Blood, it is transferred to ſome other place.</p>

Which ſort of affection, exciting Pains almoſt in all parts of the Body, one after another, although it appears like to the wandring Gout, but now deſcribed, yet it differs from it both in reſpect of the pains, which in a Rheumatiſm quicklier paſs over, and oftner change their ſeat, and that with them are very often joyned a ſmall Fever, and a tumour of the affected parts, and a <hi>phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goſis</hi> or Inflammation; as alſo by reaſon of the conjunct Cauſe, which indeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Kin to that which brings forth the ſcorbutick Colick, is clean contrary to the cauſe of the wandring Gout: For it ſeems that in the firſt preparation of this Diſeaſe, an acetous Mine is depoſited in very many places from the nervous Juice, as it were the female Seed; to which ſort of Symbols left in divers places here and there, whilſt that the blood growing hot, pours forth its plentifully rejected ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line reliques, preſently upon the wreſtling and Congreſſion of diſſimilar Particles. Pains are cauſed moreover, becauſe the recrements of the Blood being expoſed in the middle of its Courſe, they ſomething hinder its motion, therefore a tumour and Inflammation is brought upon the part affected then, becauſe the Blood at laſt licks up again the Matter, but now rejected by it ſelf, and transferrs it to ſome-other place, thoſe often ſhiftings and mutations of Pains happen. This Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on deſerves a peculiar conſideration: but this may ſuffice to have ſaid theſe few things of it in general, to wit, as it is a ſymptom of the Scurvy.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto we have unfolded the Symptoms of the Scurvy, ariſing from a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold kind of Cauſe, the Pathologie of which contains in it ſelf other manifold Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and very different in themſelves: of which it is worthy to be obſerved, that as many Diſeaſes, belonging to the Brain and nervous Stock, which exiſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often alone and of themſelves, come alſo upon the Scurvy; yet as to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal reaſons and as to the method, to be obſerved in the curing of theſe or thoſe, a very great difference occurs. But when a Palſie, Vertigo, Convulſion, Lethargy, and other Diſeaſes of that kind happen of themſelves, they always depend upon a more fixed cauſe, and very much on ſome notable fault of the Head and nervous Appendix; and as Cephalick remedies and appropiate to thoſe Diſeaſes only, are convenient, yet the ſucceſs does not eaſily nor alwais anſwer to their Wiſhes. In the mean time either little care is taken for the Emendation of the Blood, or if it be,<note place="margin">How the Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes differ being excited by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and brought on by the Scur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

The ſame obſervation is to be had in Tumors, Ulcers, the Dropſie and many other Diſtempers brought in by the Scorbutick infection, which otherways when excited by themſelves, are healed only with antiſcorbutick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies. The reaſon of which is, that in the Scurvy, the conjunct cauſe of the Symptoms and of very many Affections, conſiſts for the moſt part only in the humors, to wit, in the Blood and nervous Juice, and not in the ſolid parts, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Viſcera, Praecordia</hi> and Brain, wherefore when their Dyſcraſies or evil diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be more eaſily mended, then the evil formations of the other Diſeaſes of this kind, are more certainly and eaſilier or with leſs trouble cured, when excited by reaſon of the Scurvy than when they come to themſelves. But when the Diſeaſe is more deeply rooted, and that the principle ſolid parts are hurt, (as it many times happens) <hi>viz.</hi> when the recrements of the Blood and nervous Juice, being impacted for a long time in them hurt their Tone, ſtuff their Pores and Paſſages, and bring forth in them Scirrhous Tumours, very often, or Ulcers; the aforeſaid Symptoms, although imputed only to the Scorbutick Taint, ſeldom or never ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of a Cure, and by reaſon of this invincible Cauſe, at laſt the Scurvy it ſelf becomes deſperate and deplorable.</p>

                     <p>WHen in the ſcorbutick affection very many and ſometimes very cruel and horrid ſymptoms together are wont to oppreſs,<note place="margin">The <hi>Prognoſis</hi> in the Scurvy ought not to be without conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaation.</note> there is expected a <hi>prognoſis</hi> from the Phyſician: Yea he himſelf, that he may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inſtitute the method of Curing, carefully weighs what may be the future event of the Diſeaſe: Notwithſtanding Judgments in this caſe ought to be cautious, a long while ſuſpended and not too raſh, for very many (as have fallen under our obſervation) eſteemed deſperate, have grown well. I have knows ſome whom a a frequent and horrid <hi>Aſthma</hi> had already ſeemed to have choaked, others continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally dying with frequent ſwooning, and alſo others troubled either with the Palſie, or convulſive Paroxyſms, or with a moſt grievous Colick, to be wholly freed in a ſhort ſpace by the help of Medicines. I have again known ſome ſcorbuticks ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the Dropſie through their whole Body, others reduced by an Atrophy to an extreme leanneſs, at laſt reſtored to perfect health. Therefore although thoſe labouring with this Diſeaſe, are ſometimes urged with affections highly dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, yet if the <hi>Viſcera</hi> be ſtill indifferently whole or at leaſt not much vitiated, we ought not to deſpair of thoſe evils; excited through the mere taint of the Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy. But on the contrary, when ſymptoms leſs terrible appear, if the Contents of the <hi>Hypochondria</hi> and <hi>Abdomen</hi> become hard and as it were ſchirrous, or if the Lungs begin to be corrupted; there is no great matter or benefit to be promiſed as to the cure of the Diſeaſe: But in caſes not deſperate, where a hope of recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring health is left, or at leaſt the fear of ſudden death is far off, if perchance the queſtion be asked how ſoon or how long, how eaſily or difficultly the Cure may ſucceed, let the anſwer depend on theſe ſorts of judgments.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Scurvy as it does not ſtrait kill thoſe affected with it, or precipitate them into an incurable ſtate, ſo neither is it ſoon or eaſily cured: For the chief cauſe of the Diſeaſe conſiſting in the dyſcraſie of the Blood, is not eaſier to be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, than Wines to be reſtored to their due complexion when they are made fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or ropy: Wherefore thoſe corrupted with this taint, endure its hurt for many months, and ſometimes years, yea ſometimes through their whole life.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This Sickneſs depending on the ſulphureous-ſaline intemperateneſs of the Blood, or like to the mere hot fretted Wine, is more hardly cured; than if the ſame proceeded from the ſaline-ſulphureous dyſcraſie, or leſs aduſt like to ropy wine: For this evil conſtitution of the Blood or Wine, may be after a ſort brought again to the condition from whence it fell, but that is wont not eaſily to be reduced into the ſtate which it departed from.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Scurvy coming upon long Fevers and other Chronical Diſeaſes, is cured, or coming upon an originally, or for ſome other occaſions, ſickly conſtitution, is eſteemed of a more difficult cure, becauſe indeed in theſe caſes both the <hi>Craſis</hi> of the Blood is more vitiated, and not ſeldom alſo ſome hurt is affixed to the <hi>Viſcera.</hi> Next to theſe they are hardly cured, who by reaſon of an evil manner of living, and chiefly by the aſſiduous drinking of the more generous Liquors, have contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this taint with hurting the tone of the Ventricle and other <hi>Viſcera:</hi> But thoſe who are become ſcorbuticks by reaſon of Contagion, the unhealthfulneſs of the Air, going to Sea, or a ſedentary Life, are more often and with leſs trouble reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to health.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. This Diſeaſe being yet freſh, ſo long as the taint being included only in the bloody Maſs, is not yet impreſſed on the Brain and nervous ſtock, nor hath excited durable ſymptoms in the ſolid parts, often admits of a perfect Cure: But if the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection being more deeply rooted, is propagated into the animal Kingdom, and there produces ſpaſmodick and dolorifick paſſions, and that its poyſon hath ſpread it ſelf more largely by the eruption of ſpots and breakings forth, and by the eroſion or eating away of the Gums and Teeth, and by other pathognomick ſigns, it is
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40331:219"/> ſcarce ever wholly extirpated; but the chief buſineſs of Medicine is employed in giving help to the Symptoms moſt grievouſly urging, and in ſuppreſſing their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and extremities.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Thoſe who labour with an inveterate Scurvy, refuſe to live moderately, but indulge their ſickly appetite, readily deſiring what is nought: And beſides they are very moroſe and difficult to take Remedies, ſo that they very often delude the labour of the Phyſician, that in truth it is better to leave them to their evil <hi>genius,</hi> than to defame profitable Medicines preſcribed in this caſe altogether in vain.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Becauſe this affection growing grievous, the morbifick matter is manifold and of divers ſorts, ſo that the cauſe of the Symptoms of a various kind and nature, is engendred; therefore Remedies not only of one kind are adminiſtred, but when a certain method of Medicine, though preſcribed with the beſt judgment, profits little or nothing in the Cure, the ſick are not preſently to be left off, but other medicaments and then others are to be tryed: For indeed the ſame things are not convenient to all, nor always to the ſame perſon. In the ſick Body the powers and combinations of Salts and Sulphurs every where vary, ſo alſo Medicines not help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhould be as often changed, till ſomething congruous and helpful be light upon.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. If that notwithſtanding or by the uſe of Remedies not rightly adminiſtred, the Scurvy by degrees growing grievous, is carried daily into a worſe condition, at length it induces a Dropſie or Conſumption, the next paſſage then is to Death, either from this or that Diſeaſe: For after that the Blood is very much depraved, it pours forth its recrements, being more plentifully heaped up either on the Lungs, or in the <hi>Viſcera</hi> of the lower Belly; and ſo cauſes an affection of this or that kind equally mortal.</p>

                     <p>AS to what reſpects the Cure of the Scurvy, for that it is not one ſimple pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural affection, but a whole Legion that is to be put to flight; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the method of Curing ought to comprehend manifold indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,<note place="margin">The Indication three-fold.</note> and thoſe variouſly complicated and ſubordinate, which after the ordinary mode may be referred to theſe three heads: to wit, that they be preſervatory which reſpect and take away the cauſe of the Diſeaſe, and curatory which reſpect and take away the Diſeaſe it ſelf and its ſymptoms, and laſtly vital, which may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend or reſtore the power and ſtrength of the Patient.</p>

                        <note place="margin">1 <hi>Preſervative.</hi>
                        </note>At the very beginning of the Cure we ought to aim at the cauſe of the Diſeaſe, for this like the Root being cut off or pulled away, preſently the Trunk, Branches, and Fruit wither: Therefore as we have ſhown the cauſe of the Scurvy to be found<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed in the dyſcraſie of the Blood, <hi>viz.</hi> being either ſulphureouſly-ſalt or ſaltiſhly-ſulphureous; the firſt work muſt be that it may be mended and made better, both of this or of that ſort or nature. To this end in the firſt place impediments are to be taken away, then the primary intention it ſelf is to be performed; for either ſcope or purpoſe Remedies are required, from Diet, Chirurgery, and Medicine: As to Diet, there ſhall be ſhewn hereafter a ſpecial method of living, in the mean time we will proceed to the reſt.</p>
                     <p>The Reduction of the Blood to its due <hi>Craſis</hi> by appropriate Remedies, is chiefly hindred by theſe two ways, <hi>viz.</hi> In the firſt place, becauſe a proviſion of vitious nutritious Juice is continually inferred by it: Then Secondly, becauſe the Recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments brought into its boſom are not ſufficiently ſent away through convenient ſinks: Therefore care muſt be taken that the buſineſs of the Chyle may be rightly perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the firſt paſſages, both that the vaporous Recrements may be ſufficiently purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40331:219"/> forth by Sweat, the ſerous by the Reins and Lymphaeducts, the bilous by the galliſh <hi>Cyſtis,</hi> the melancholy by the Spleen, and all the others of every kind by their proper emunctories; then theſe offices being rightly inſtituted we muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to reduce by ſpecifick Medicines, and chiefly thoſe endued with a volatile Salt, the dyſcraſie of the Blood: Remedies reſpecting every one of theſe intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ought to be uſed and adminiſtred together, but by what means and by what manner of adminiſtrations, ſhall be yet more particularly deſigned.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the Chyle may be perfectly concocted in the firſt paſſages,<note place="margin">The Therapeutick Intentions.</note> care muſt be taken that the load of excrementitious matter heaped up in them may be extermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, that the ferment being loſt or depraved may be reſtored, that the paſſages and pores any ways ſtuft and obſtructed may be opened: To theſe ends, Cathar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, Digeſtive, and opening Medicines are deſtinated.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Excrements gathered together in the bloody Maſs, when they are not ſufficiently ſent away by their proper emunctories, may be drawn forth by other convenient ways: For this purpoſe alſo Catharticks or Purgers, and beſides Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoreticks and Diureticks, or Medicines that evacuate by Sweat and Urine, are convenient.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The ſcorbutick dyſcraſie of the Blood ſhould be mended by Phlebotomy and ſpecifick Remedies: Wherefore that the whole buſineſs of the preſervatory indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation may be reduced to one point, the Remedies which perform its chief inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are Catharticks, Blood-letting, Digeſtives, opening Medicines, Diaphore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, Diureticks, and Anti-ſcorbuticks or Specificks. Then, for that indeed Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtive and opening Medicines are imbued, either of them with acid, biting, or ſaline Particles, they more often overcome; beſides, for that Medicines of this ſort move conveniently enough by Sweat or by Urine, therefore the Curatory proviſion requiſite to the aforeſaid intentions, may be yet reduced to ſtraiter limits; to wit, that it may almoſt only conſiſt in Cathartick, Digeſtive, and Anti-ſcorbutick Medicines, to which Phlebotomy may be added as occaſion ſerves: It now is my part to deſign ſome forms and preſcripts of them, and alſo the manner of uſing them.</p>

By this way of Vomiting the mere Contents of the Stomach being wiped from its foldings are ſent forth; neither are there ſtirred up in any other of the <hi>Viſcera</hi> about it, or in the Membranes (as it is wont to happen from Stybiates or Antimonial Emeticks) painful haulings or Convulſive, with ſwoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or fainting away.

                        <p>We might here add many other forms of Purges, but there is no great need of variety in theſe: of the aforeſaid, either theſe or thoſe which ſhall be thought moſt convenient, let them be adminiſtred, and every 5 or 6 days as occaſion ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire iterated. Too often and violent purging, deſtroys the ſtrength and very much waſts the force of the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> and in the mean time takes not away the Diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>After a Purge or two, if there be any need of taking away Blood,<note place="margin">Phlebotomy.</note> let it be done either by Phlebotomy in the Arms, or by Leeches in the Veins of the Fundament. It is not much matter which Vein is Cut: nor is there ſo much benefit in the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Salvatella, as hath been commonly thought. The great do among Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, who were ignorant of the Circulation of the Blood, about opening the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalick, or the Liver Vein, or any other chiefly in the Scurvy comes to nothing. Phlebotomie is indicated by the plentifulneſs and Vitiouſneſs of the Blood, which rather ought to be performed by taking away a ſmall quantity often, than a great deal all at once: For when the bloody Liquor becomes very impure, it is not more certainly mended by any kind of Remedies, than by letting it forth often and ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly. For as often as the old corrupted Blood is let forth, freſh, better and more pure ſucceeds. In the mean time there is neeed of Caution, leſt too great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be taken away at once, for its ſtock being diminiſhed together, Sanguification grows weak, and for that reaſon a Dropſy, or a Cachexia, or evil diſpoſition of the whole Body follows.</p>
                        <p>After Purging, and (if need be) Phlebotomy, many other kinds of Remedies, no leſs neceſſary, are required in the Scurvie: In the praeſcribing of which in order, we ought preſently to conſider whether the Indications being only Praeſervatory they may have place here, or ought not to be deferred to thoſe which are contrary, to wit, thoſe which reſpect the more grievous Symptoms: But if you endeavour the whole buſineſs of the Cure againſt the cauſe of this Diſeaſe, proceed according to the following method: It ſhall be ſhown hereafter what ſort of Cure is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, (if perchance occaſion requires) to the Symptoms.</p>
                        <p>Therefore if the buſineſs of Medicine be chiefly deſigned againſt the cauſe of the Scurvy, and that it may be firſt eradicated by it ſelf for this end, as we ſhewed but now, there are moreover to be made uſe of at all times except on the days of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, Digeſtive and Specifick, or antiſcorbutick Remedies: to which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times if need be, may be added Diaphoreticks, or Diureticks, or Medicines ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating by Sweat or Urine. The forms of Medicines, for the performing theſe kind of Intentions, and manifold Praeſcriptions, and of various kinds, are every where extant among Authors. It pleaſes me however, to place here ſome of the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:40331:221"/> more ſelect, which I think good to diſtinguiſh into two Claſſes, according to the twoſold nature of the Scurvy, to wit, the ſulphureous Saline, and Saline Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous. And in the firſt place we will deliver what is convenient in the latter Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, to wit, where there is need of Medicines, indued with a certain Incitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and very much filled with a volatile Salt.</p>

                              <p>The ſimple water of the leaves of Aron being diſtilled in the Spring time, is an efficacious Remedy againſt the Scurvy, if it be taken to the quantity of 3 or 4 ounces twice a day with ſome other Medicine.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Of the Curatory Indication of the Scurvy, by which help is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded to the Diſeaſe it ſelf, and to the Symptoms chiefly afflicting.</head>
                     <p>VVE have hitherto treated concerning the Cure of the Scurvy, and ſhewed what belongs to the preſervatory indication, to wit, the taking away of the morbifick cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> both the intentions of healing and manifeſt Remedies. Which kind of method being timely entred upon and rightly inſtituted, oftentimes performs the whole buſineſs, for that the cauſe of the ſickneſs or the Root being cut off, the diſtempers depending upon it wither away of their own accord. But yet we may not always follow this courſe directly, but ſometimes ſtepping of one ſide, go another way to work, becauſe ſometimes more grievous accidents and ſymptoms happen, which require peculiar and as it were extraordinary help of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, which ought to be attended upon immediately, and the general Cure often interrupted: As to this it is to be obſerved, that when the diſtempers which follow upon the Scurvy, require proper Remedies according to the nature of every one of them, and the diſpoſition of the Patient, yet there ought always to be mixed with theſe Anti-ſcorbuticks. There will be no need to inſtitute a curatory method, againſt all the diſeaſes and diſtempers with which the Scurvy is wont to environ one, for ſo I might tranſcribe the whole practice of Medicine, but we ſhall have regard only to the ſymptoms chiefly afflicting, by which either the life of the Patient is endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered, or the principal Cure is hindred: By what means and with what Medicines ſuch may be cured, we ſhall now ſhew.</p>

                        <p>Difficult breathing with ſtraitneſs of the Breaſt and aſthmatical fits, ought to be taken away by appropriate Remedies, and to be preſcribed beſides the general me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, otherwiſe the ſick may be ſoon brought into danger of life. As theſe kinds of evils ariſe for the moſt part in ſcorbutical perſons, by the vice of the Blood ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating in the heart, or by reaſon of the pneumonick Nerves, being hindred in their function, ſo they are to be cured with Cardiacks or anti-ſpaſmodick Medicines, <hi>viz.</hi> of Hartshorn, Soot, Blood, of mens Skulls, alſo the tincture of <hi>Caſtor,</hi> Antimony, or of Sulphur, the flowers of <hi>Sal Armoniac,</hi> the flowers of Benjamin, alſo <hi>Elixir Proprietatis,</hi> in theſe caſes are of excellent uſe: Which kind of Remedies may be given at every turn, with a doſe of ſome anti-ſcorbutick Liquor, proper alſo againſt the aforeſaid diſtemper. For the ſudden allaying of difficult breathing, merely ſpaſmodical when it afflicts very ſore, I never found a more ready Remedy than 10 or 12 drops of our tincture of opiate <hi>Laudanum,</hi> being given in ſome convenient Liquor, for that ſleep creeping on the Spirits remit their inordinations, and being in the interim refreſhed, they reſume afterwards their priſtine task after a due man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. The more ſharp Clyſters which very much cleanſe the Belly, alſo ſudorifick Decoctions and Diureticks often give help.</p>

                        <p>Sometimes ſcorbutical People are wont to be cruelly tormented with great pain and fulneſs of the Ventricle, alſo with a nauſeouſneſs and belchings, and ſometimes alſo with cruel and frequent vomiting. Which kind of vices ariſe ſometimes from the Chyle, being there degenerated into a putrefying humour, but more often from the morbifick matter being carried away, either by the paſſage of the Blood or the nervous Juice, and depoſited either in the cavity of the Stomach, or fixed in the nervous folds and membranes. In theſe caſes if a viſcid or ropy ſtinking matter, or otherways hurtful be caſt out by vomiting, and that it be ſuſpected that the cauſe remains within the cavity of the Ventricle, a gentle Vomit of wine of Squills, or of vitriol Salt, will be convenient to be taken: Or if the peccant humour di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbs the Belly, either an extract of Rhubarb or an infuſion of it, the Salt or Cream of Tartar being added. But if the matter ſticks cloſely within the Membranes or nervous foldings, Diaphoreticks, or things reſtraining the effervencies of the Salts rather help: <hi>Elixir Proprietatis,</hi> or the flowers of <hi>Sal Armoniac,</hi> or the Spirits of Soot may be taken by turns, with the water of Radiſhes compound, or of Snails, or any other anti-ſcorbutick Liquor. In the mean time, once or twice in a day there may be applied to the region of the Stomach, a fomentation of Wormwood, Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taury, Camomil Flowers, the Roots of Gentian and others, boyled in Whitewine, with woollen Stuphs dipt in it and wrung out very hot. The uſe of Clyſters is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, and not ſeldom Opiates yield great help.</p>

                        <p>There is almoſt no Diſtemper requires the ſpeedy help of Medicine more than the Colick and torments of the Belly, which frequently happen in the Scurvy. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe evils, Clyſters of ſeveral ſorts, Fomentations, Liniments, and Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſms are adminiſtred. Here the uſe of Opiates are thought to be very neceſſary, certainly in this caſe that preſcript of <hi>Riverius,</hi> that purging Pills ſhould be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred with ſome <hi>Laudanum</hi> mixed with them, may take place; for by ſleep being moved, and a plentiful ſolution of the Belly being cauſed, very often the fits are taken away: But the pouders of Shell-fiſh, by which the acetoſous Salts are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed or fixed, conduce very much to the profligating or driving away the morbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick cauſe. As for example, take of the pouder of Crabs eyes, and of Egg ſhells each <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>iſs, of Pearls <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>i, make a pouder, let it be divided into 12 doſes, let one of which be taken every ſixth hour, with ſcorbutick water or with the decoction of the Seeds and Roots of Burdocks, as is above deſcribed, or elſe with poſſet drink, in which is boyled the Roots and ſeeds of Burdocks, the leaves of ſweet Marjoram, and Saxifrage, and the leaves of Scurvygraſs infuſed. In the ſcorbutick Colick, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the diſtempers of the Ventricle, but now deſcribed the uſe of <hi>Epſom</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi> purging waters or the like, affords oftentimes very great benefit.</p>

Take of the Conſerves of common Wormwood made with an equal part of Sugar ℥vj, (in a more hot conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, inſtead of this let Conſerves of red Roſes be taken) <hi>ſpecies Diarrhodon Abbatis</hi>

                        <p>The <hi>Vertigo</hi> often comes upon an inveterate Scurvy, to which is wont to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a fainting or frequent ſinking of the Spirits, and almoſt a continual fear or dread of it, alſo a <hi>ſtupor</hi> or ſtiffneſs in the members, and a ſenſe of tingling or pricking here and there running about them, which kind of diſtempers proceed from the failure of the animal Spirits in the fountain it ſelf, and ſometimes of thoſe within the Nerves, both the Cardiack and thoſe ſerving for the motion of the Members, and when they depend on the Brain and nervous ſtock, being beſet very much with the ſcorbutick Salt, they are not eaſily cured.

                        <p>For the ſtaying of the Blood when it breaks forth immoderately, the method is commonly known, and there is nothing more to be done or particular in this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper by reaſon of the Scurvy, than when excited upon other occaſions: But as to the preventing Haemorrhagies, Remedies, which take away the acrimony of the

                        <p n="1">1. When therefore the fleſh of the Gums begins firſt to ſwell up, and to become ſpungy by reaſon of the influx of a corrupt and ſalt Blood and <hi>Serum;</hi> take the middle bark of the Elder Tree and of the Elm each <hi>m</hi> ſs, of the leaves of Savory, Sage, Hedg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſtard, garden Creſſes, each <hi>m</hi> j, of the roots of Pellitory <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ij, being bruiſed and cut let them be boyled in <abbr>lb</abbr>iij of Lime water, to the conſumption of the third part: If a ſweetning be required, add of honey of Roſes ℥ii, make a Gargal. Or take of Camphorated Vitriol ℥i, (commonly called by our Countrymen by the name of Captain <hi>Green</hi>'s Pouder) a quart of Spring water, mingle them in a glaſs and ſhake them well together, and then the Liquor ſettling and growing clear, may be made uſe of. Or let there be prepared a Lye of the aſhes of Broom, or Roſemary, or of Nitre, or Tartar calcined, boyl in 3 pints of this, of the leaves of Savory, Thyme, Sage, Roſemary, each <hi>m</hi> j, when it is ſtrained put into it two handfuls of Scurvy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graſs leaves, make an infuſion cloſe and warm for three hours, then let it be ſtrained again, and kept to waſh the mouth often in a day.</p>
                        <p>For the ſame intention alſo, Liniments may between whiles, and eſpecially at night be applied, that their virtues may be communicated to thoſe that are ſick, or while they are ſleeping. There is a preſcript very celebrious among Authors, and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40331:227"/> by long uſe confirmed. Take of the Leaves of Columbine, of curled Mint, Sage, Nutmeg, Mirrh (which ſometimes may be omitted) of each <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ij, of burnt Allum ℥ſs, of Virgin Hony ℥iiij, or what will ſuffice, make a Liniment according to Art.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. When the Fleſh of the Gums growing flaggy, forſakes the Roots of the Teeth, ſometimes a light Scarification may be adminiſtred, beſides let the mouth be waſhed with this Decoction.

If at any time (as ſometimes it is wont) that deep and putrid Ulcers eat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Gums or other parts of the Mouth, the aforeſaid more ſtrong Remedies are often to be uſed. Beſides, let little raggs be often applyed to the affected place, ſteeped in Egyptian Oyntment diſſolved in the Spirit of Wine, or in an Infuſion of Sublimate, or of the medicinal Stone. In theſe caſes the Cure is to be left to a skilful Chirurgion.</p>

                        <p>As to the firſt, thoſe which move by Sweat and alſo by Urine, does often avail, for that they carry another way, the lixivial and ſour recrements of the Blood and nervous Juice, that are wont to be gathered together in the affected part: But cheifly thoſe things are to be adminiſterd, which may defend either Humour from its depraved nature, <hi>viz.</hi> both Saline and Sour: ſhelly Pouders, Crabs Eys, Jaws of Pikes, alſo Spirits, and Flowers of <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> Spirits of Blood, Tincture of Antimony and of Coral: Decoctions of the Roots and Seeds of Burdocks, <hi>Chamepitys,</hi> Germander, very much help.

                           <hi>Eugalenus, Wierus,</hi> the <hi>Campen</hi> Phyſitian, and <hi>Gregorius Horſtius,</hi> have wrot particularly of this diſtemper, ſaid to be very frequent in the Northern Countries of <hi>Belgia.</hi> A certain Sign of which is manifeſted by putting a live Worm to the grieved place, for he is preſently wont to leap off, twine himſelf about, bend himſelf round, to ſlide along, and to dye: which I have alſo often experimented on our Country men. The reaſon of which Experiment (as it ſeems) is this: we have determined the cauſe of the Pain and Tumour ſtirred up in the affected part, to be for that the ſaline or Lixivial Faeculencies from the Blood, and the ſour, from the nervous Juice, being depoſited in the ſame place, do mutually fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or grow hot, even as Spirits of Vitriol and Salt of Tartar, mingled by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquium or melting: further from ſuch a ſtriving and agitation of diſſimilar par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, as the Pain and Tumour are cauſed, ſo indeed very ſharp, and as it were Corroſive <hi>Efluvia's</hi> plentifully evaporate, which kill the worm layd upon the grieved place, even as if he ſhould be held over thoſe Liquors boyling: Becauſe of the effect of this Experiment, the cure of this Diſeaſe has been ordained by Worms, to wit, Remedies prepared of them; but I know not whether being taken inwardly, they ſo certainly deſtroy the Diſeaſe, as they being applyed out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, are deſtroyed by the Diſeaſe. Even as Worms, ſo alſo Snails, Hoglice, or Sows, and other bloodleſs little animals, for that they abound in a volatile Salt, do often enough become an efficacious remedy.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Henry Petraeus</hi> relates two remedies uſed againſt this Diſeaſe, in <hi>Weſtphalia.</hi> Take 9 Worms bruiſed together, with two ſpoonfuls of Wine in a Morter, and wrung out hard through a woollen Cloth, to theſe add half a meaſure of Wine, and let it be taken 3 ſpoonfuls morning, noon and night, for ſeveral days. 2. Take two or three ſpriggs of Savin, two ſpoonfuls of Virgins Hony, let them be boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in a meaſure of Wine, till two fingers breadth be waſted: let it be ſtrained, and take of it 4 or 5 ſpoonfuls thrice in a day. A certain Vulgar Potion, a kin to the former Medicine, is cited by <hi>Horſtius,</hi> and called the Monaſterie Potion: Take of Sage Betony, Rue, of each 5 Leaves, of earth Worms, every one with red rings about their Necks, number 5, a little Savin, of Devils bit Roots 2, let them be bruſed with Water of Elder Flowers, and the Juice being preſſed forth, let it be given to move Sweat. Alſo the like preſcript is propoſed by the <hi>Campen</hi> Phyſitian in <hi>Foreſtus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Certainly in this diſtemper the Magiſterial Water of Earthworms, preſcribed in the London Diſpenſatory, is extreamly convenient. I have often given alſo with good ſucceſs, the Spirits and Salts of Harts horn, the Spirit of Blood, and the Flowers of <hi>Sal Armoniack.</hi> Beſides the ſhelly Pouders, as of Crabs Eyes, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, Perls, and Vegetables, which have in them Antidotes for the Gout, as the Roots of Birthwort, the Leaves of Groundpine, Germander, and the like joyned with Antiſcorbuticks, conduce to the cure of this Diſeaſe. Outwardly, for the allaying of the Pains, beſides Anodynes, things under the form of a Liniment, Fomentation, or Cataplaſm, are made uſe of: The Oyl of Earth-worms, Froggs, and Toads, are often very profitable. I was told by a very ſignal Perſon much obnoxious to this Diſeaſe, that the Water of the Contents, taken from the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle of an Ox newly killed, and drawn off clear by diſtillation, and with Raggs dipt in it warm, and applyed for a Fomentation, brings certain help.</p>

                        <head>Of the Atrophy or waſting of the Fleſh: alſo of the Scorbutick Fever, which oftentimes is either the Cauſe of it, or the accident, or effect of it.</head>
                        <p>There are three kinds of Cauſes, hanging by a certain Series, from one of which or more the ſcorbutick Atrophy without the Conſumption of the Lungs is wont to be produced, <hi>viz.</hi> either the Chyle is perverted by the default of the firſt paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, by which means it does not carry ſufficient or laudable proviſion to the Blood. Secondly, or being brought to it, yet by the fault of the Blood, it is not right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly changed into Blood and nutricious Juice. Or thirdly and laſtly, the nutricious Juice being prepared in the bloody Maſs, by reaſon of the fault of the nervous Liquor, is not rightly aſſimilated in the ſolid parts.</p>
                        <p>The Remedies appropriate to this Symptome reſpect either the emendation of the firſt paſſages, or of the aforeſaid Humors. As to the firſt, ſometimes it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens by reaſon of the Tone of the Stomach being broken, or its Ferment vitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſo that it comes to paſs that the aliments put therein are not rightly dreſſed, but turn into an unprofitable Rottenneſs. To theſe ſort of evils, gentle Cathar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, digeſtives and ſtrengthners are to be adminiſterd. But more often the work of Chylification or of making the Chyle, is hindered by reaſon of a Schir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Tumour, being excited now in the Ventricle, now in the Meſentery or in the circumjacent part. In this caſe opening and diſſolving things are convenient; and the uſe of Spaws or Purging Waters has bore away the Bell from all other reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: Beſides Fomentations, Liniments, or Plaſters, ought to be outwardly applyed.</p>
                        <p>Further, it ſometimes happens that without any Tumor ſtirred up in the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> the milkie Veſſels being impacted by ſome thick and viſcous Matter, to be ſo much obſtructed, that the Proviſion of Chyle, though laudable enough and plentifully made, is not ſufficiently carried into the Blood. In this diſtemper, for the moſt part the Belly voides copiouſly white excrements like curdled Milk, and not like others dyed or ſtinking with Choler. The reaſon of which is, for that the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſhed Blood more ſparingly begets the yellow bile, from which being poured into the Inteſtines, the colour and ſtink of the Excrements proceed. In this caſe the purging Spaws are convenient, and alſo with things opening, taken inwardly, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niments, Fomentations, and Baths are uſed outwardly.</p>
                        <p>Againſt the <hi>Maraſmus</hi> or waſting of the Fleſh, ariſing from the fault of the Blood, degenerating from its Complexion, Aſſes or Cows Milk diluted with Water, or other proper Water diſtilled, often brings help. The broth of Snails or milk Meats, with them boyled in them; beſides diſtilled waters of Milk or Whey, with Snails and temperate antiſcorbutick Herbs mixed, help very much in this Caſe: alſo to this end, decoctions with Vulnerary and antiſcorbutick Herbs infuſed therein are taken with good ſucceſs: In the mean time Frictions to the external parts, with woollen coathes made warm and dipped in reſumptive Oyntment, or the freſh Oyl of Walnuts, may be dayly adminiſtred.</p>
                        <p>When the Atrophy ariſes from the Vice of the diſtempered Blood, perverting

                        <p>This Diſtemper we have determined to proceed from the congreſſion and mutual effervencies of the Salts which are of a divers nature and generation, to wit, of the fixed coming from the Blood, and the acetous coming from the nervous Juice. The ſubjects of either Salts are the ſuperfluous feculencies depoſited, and by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid humours acted into certain turgeſcencies or riſings up, being ſpread abroad into the parts, now into theſe now into thoſe: Wherefore that the Diſeaſe may be cured, and the turgeſcencies of the humors allayed, both their ſuperfluous feculen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are to be purged forth, and alſo both the degenerate Salts of either order, are to be reduced and made volatile.</p>
                        <p>For the two former intentions, a light Purge and Phlebotomy are chiefly requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and ought to be often repeated according to the ſtrength of the Patient; alſo Diureticks and Diaphoreticks which may convey forth ſome way the ſalt Seroſities, are next to be given: That theſe ſort of Evacuations may the better ſucceed leiſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with a good habit and nature aſſiſting, Opiates are often made uſe of: For the other ſcope on which the chief hinge of the cure doth turn, alteratives, and chiefly thoſe which are indued with a volatile Salt, do greatly help: Wherefore in this caſe it is a common, but not to be contemned Medicine, to drink twice or thrice a day 4 or 6 ounces of an Infuſion made of Stone-horſe dung, in ſmall Wine or Ale or in proper diſtilled water. But a Medicine a little more grateful, though not more efficacious may be prepared, if a water be diſtilled out of that Dung with anti ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butick Ingredients, infuſed in Whitewine or Cyder; which may be taken twice in a day from ℥iij to ℥iiij, I have often preſcribed in this caſe Spirit of Hartshorn, and of Blood, with very ſignal benefit to the ſick.</p>

                        <head>Of the Crackling of the Bones.</head>
                        <p>There yet remains a ſymptom ſometimes, though rarely coming upon the Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, <hi>viz.</hi> a crackling of the Bones, the cure and reaſon of which being omitted in the former Pathology, it will not be amiſs to ſpeak of it here. I have known ſome, but not above three or four, who whilſt they laboured with the Scurvy were troubled with its evil, not only in the humours and fleſhy parts, but at laſt alſo in the Bones themſelves, for as often as they bended any of their Members any way, the heads of the Bones as if they were naked, rubbing againſt one another made a great noiſe: Further, as they lay in bed and turned themſelves from one ſide to the other, a great noiſe from the colliſion of the <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> as if it were the ſhaking of a skeleton, was plainly heard, even affrighting thoſe ſo affected.</p>
                        <p>The Conjunct Cauſe of this perhaps may ſeem to be, that the ſoft <hi>interſtitium</hi> of the Bones, <hi>viz.</hi> the Fat, Membranes, and Ligaments, being greatly waſted, their junctures even as milſtones, being altogether emptied by reaſon of their mutual rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing together, make a noiſe: But the matter is quite otherwiſe, becauſe thoſe that are greatly waſted away have not this crackling noiſe of the Bones, nor do thoſe who labour with this Diſtemper always waſte off their fleſh: Wherefore we rather ſay that the immediate cauſe of this ſymptom, is the dryneſs of the Bones or a defect of the <hi>medulla</hi> or marrow ſo properly called, which ought to be contained within the cavities of the Bones, and chiefly within their heads: For as certain Bones do include marrow or an unctuous humour every where ſhaken out, either from the great cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or pores, and the ſmall paſſages, we have determined the uſe of this to be, that both the Bones being thus moiſtned, may become leſs brittle, and moreover, that this humour moiſtning the knobs of the Bones, may make ſlippery all the joyntings, even as Greaſe or Oyl the hinges of a Machine, and by that means facilitates their motion: Wherefore the heads of the Bones being deſtitute of this marrow, make a noiſe like to the wheel of a Cart that is ſeldom greas'd.</p>
                        <p>But if the proctaartick or more remote cauſe be inquired into, <hi>viz.</hi> wherefore
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40331:230"/> that unctuous liniment of the Joynts becomes defective; this indeed is to be imputed either to the vice of the Blood, as if it did not ſupply the Bones with aliment, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipating equally with Sulphur and Salt, which truly ſeems unlikely, becauſe the bloudy Maſs alſo in ſcorbutical perſons, contains Particles of either of the aforeſaid kinds, and for that theſe labouring with the crackling of the Bones, have their Skin and Muſcles ſufficiently moiſtned with fatneſs: Or ſecondly and more likely, this unctuous humor by which the Joyntings are made ſlippery is wanting, through the fault of the Bones themſelves, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe their pores and paſſages being ſo much obſtructed by ſome extraneous, and perhaps muddy matter, or tartareous carried thither by the Blood, that for that reaſon they cannot receive ſufficiently the Balſom deſtinated for them, nor ſend it forth for the moiſtning their Joyntings: It will not be eaſie (for that the matter lies ſo abſtruſe) to inveſtigate the particular reaſons of this Diſtemper, nor to conjecture further in this Aetiology.</p>
                        <p>We are no leſs at a loſs, how to proceed in the cure of this Diſeaſe: For although the primaay indication, <hi>viz.</hi> the humectation of the Bones or Joyntings is obvious enough, yet by what means and by what Remedies that ſhould be performed, does not ſo plainly appear. For I have known in this caſe very many kinds of Medicines, and ſeveral ways of Adminiſtrations tryed altogether in vain. A certain ingenious man, labouring for many years with this Diſeaſe, had taken the advice of many, and of the moſt famous Phyſicians, and beſides the uſual Remedies againſt the Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, (together with often letting Blood and purgations, from which he received no help) he tryed various and long courſes of Phyſick without any ſucceſs: for after he had underwent a method preſcribed by one Phyſicion for ſome months in vain, he applyed himſelf to another and ſo again to more. In the mean time, from each of them was preſcribed always a new way of curing, uneſſayed by the former: Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, Liniments, and Frictions are daily applyed to the Joynts, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Baths at Bath were uſed, and then ſeveral ſorts of purging waters, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times one ſometimes another were drunk; all which nothing helping out, a chaly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beate courſe was taken, and another time a decoction of the more temperate woods, ſometime a Milk Diet, and again at another time Electuaries, diſtilled waters, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pozems,</hi> and other Remedies prepared againſt the Scurvy. After this manner when he had lived almoſt conſtantly medically and miſerably above three years, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing profited as to the Cure of the aforeſaid Diſeaſe, but in the mean time he was indifferently well as to his ſtrength and Stomach, he married, and as to the reſt of the common Symptoms of the Scurvy became better: Hence it appears too perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious a Diſeaſe, yielding almoſt to no Remedies, the crackling of the Bones is, which I have alſo proved in others, labouring with the ſame Diſtemper altogether mocking and eluding the skill and pains of the Phyſician.</p>

                     <p>WE have hitherto largely unfolded the Indications both Preſervatory and Curatory, which belong to the Cure of the Scurvy, it yet remains that we ſpeak of the vital Indication, to wit, that we may declare by what method and by what Remedies, the ſtrength of the ſick being too apt to languiſh, may be ſuſtained, or being loſt and caſt down may be reſtored. For theſe ends, Cordials and Opiates are preſcribed to be taken, according to the exigencies of the ſick, and beſides a right way of living as to Diet, and if need be an analeptick or reſtorative, and always anti-ſcorbutick is preſcribed.</p>
                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:40331:230"/>
                     <p>As to Cardiack Medicines, to wit, which thorowly agitate the Blood, ſtagna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the heart, reſuſcitate or raiſe up its half ſpent flame, reſtore the animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits oppreſſed or diſtracted to a free and due irradiation, it is obvious that very many Remedies which properly are called Anti-ſcorbuticks, do perform theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, of which ſort are the compound water of Radiſhes, the magiſterial of Snails and Earthworms, the Spirits of Hartshorn and Soot, the ſhelly Pouders with many others, which are not only taken with benefit at certain hours, according to a method ordained in a certain order, but alſo as occaſion ſhall ſerve when ever a <hi>ſyncope</hi> or fainting of the Spirits ſhall happen.</p>
                     <p>But beſides thoſe who are found very obnoxious to paſſions of the Heart, frequent Swoonings, Nauſeouſneſs, Vomiting, Tremblings; <hi>Vertigo's,</hi> and other horrid Symptoms, have alſo ready other ſorts of Medicines, more properly Cordials, by which they give relief immediately to their fainting Spirits. To this end is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient the <hi>Elixir Vitae</hi> of the greater compoſition, in the diſtillation of the ſame <hi>Elixir,</hi> the ſecond water may be given to a ſpoonful ſweetned, alſo the Bezoartick Water, <hi>Aqua mirabilis, Gilbert</hi>'s temperate water, Treacle and Cinnamon water, to each of which compounded or of themſelves, may be added <hi>Confectio Alchermes, Confectio de Hyacintho,</hi> pouder of Pearls or the magiſtery of Coral, Syrup of Clove Gillyflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, of Coral, of Citron peels, or of Cinnamon: Of theſe and others of this Rank; divers forms of Medicines are wont to be preſcribed, as for Example.</p>
                     <p>Take of Treacle water and <hi>Aqua mirabilis</hi> each ℥iij, of Balm water ℥iiij, of the Syrup of Clovegillyflowers ℥iſs, of the Confection of <hi>Alchermes</hi>

                     <p>As to what relates to Opiates and anodyne Medicines, in ſome diſtempers of Scorbuticks, I had rather want the uſe of any other kind of Medicines beſides than of theſe, for indeed I have found by often experience, that there is no better Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, not only againſt pertinacious pains and wakings, but in aſthmatical parox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yſms, in Vomiting, Fluxes, and alſo in the <hi>Vertigo,</hi> and in the Convulſive Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, as often as nature being irritated or provoked above meaſure, hath fallen into moſt cruel inordinations, than that Sleep might be allured by ſome ſafe Narcotick being given: In the mean time there is need of caution, that they be not taken when there is any thing in the conſtitution of the Sick, or in the condition or time of the Diſeaſe, that may forbid the exhibition of ſuch a Medicine.</p>
                     <p>Beſides the hypnoticks uſual in the Apothecaries Shops, <hi>viz.</hi> Opiate, <hi>Laudanum, Nepenthe, Philonium, Diacodium,</hi> and Syrup of wild Poppies, I know two prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of <hi>Opium,</hi> which I am wont to give in the form of a Tincture or more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid extract, with any other appropriate Liquor from 10 to 20 drops.</p>
                     <p>Diet or the manner of living, to be obſerved by Scorbuticks in the curatory me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, is not of the leaſt moment, which being neglected or ill inſtituted, the other preſcripts of Medicine profit very little or nothing towards health: As the diaetetick Rule extends it ſelf to various things, yet chiefly it is imployed about the Air, the ſoyl of the habitation, Meat and Drink, and the motion and reſt of the Body.</p>
                     <p>As to the firſt, what kind of places and manſions in reſpect of the Heaven and Soil, do breed the Scurvy, and therefore ought to be avoided, appears ſufficiently
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:40331:231"/> by what we have above declared. Thoſe who ſtudie to prevent or to cure this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, let them endeavour to choſe an Aire moderately hot and dry, and which ſhall be alſo thin and pure and ſufficiently eventilated or winnowed.</p>
                     <p>Meats only for good Juice and well cooked are convenient, heavy, ſlimy, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefied, fennewed and meats dryed in the Smoak, alſo unfermented aliments, or greatly compounded, Pulſe, Milkmeats, and unripe Fruits are to be ſhunned, Sweatmeats or things candied, or very much imbued with Sugar, I ſo much blame, that I am apt to think the Invention and immoderate uſe of them, to have contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted very much to the cruel increaſe of the Scurvy in this Age. For indeed that Concreet is made up of a Salt ſufficiently ſharp and Corroſive, though mitigated with Sulphur, as may plainly appear by a Spagyrical <hi>Analyſis</hi> made of it. For Sugar (as we intimated before) being diſtilled by it ſelf, yields a liquor, little inferior to the Stygian Water: for if you ſhall diſtil it, being poured to a good deal of ſpring Water in a Bladder, although the fixed Salt does not ſo aſcend, yet it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces a Liquor like to the ſharpeſt <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> burning and highly pricking: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as Sugar being commixed almoſt with every aliment, is ſo plentifully taken in by uſe, it is very likely that from its daily uſe, the Blood and the Humours are rendered ſalt and ſharp, and from thence Scorbutick. A very famous Author hath attributed the cauſe of the Engliſh Phthiſick, or Conſumption, to the immoderate uſe of Sugar among our country men, and I know no reaſon, but that I may rather think the increaſe of the Scurvy derives it ſelf from this enkindling.</p>
                     <p>Let the Drink be midling Beer, mild and clear, and altered with antiſcorbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Ingredients, but without any ingrateful taſte; let it not be thick nor ſweet, nor too ſalt and ſour, and let it be taken in a moderate quantity, and almoſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the ſet times of Dinner and Supper: That which with many is thought a good Cuſtom, to wit, that as ſoon as they are out of their beds, to indulge themſelves with (as they uſually ſay) a large mornings draught, ſeems to be very pernicious. For by this means, for that the ſanguiferous Veſſels are too much filled with the proviſion of freſh Chyle, almoſt perpetually poured in, both Crudities and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bifick Faeculencies are begotten in the Blood, and the office of Sanguification great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weakned. It is better indeed for moſt men (unleſs ſuch, who whilſt they are empty and uſed to have their Ventricle grievouſly wrinkled and drawn together) to remain faſting till dinner, nor is it a leſs adverſary to health, according to the uſual cuſtom, to fill themſelves with drinking full Cups preſently after Dinner. Wines or Cyder ſo they be mild, right and not adulterated, and moderately tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, do not hurt; but there is nothing more hurtful and injurious to our health, than thoſe adulterated, ropie, ſharp and growing ſour.</p>
                     <p>Exerciſe and Labour is ſo very profitable, both for the curing and the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Scurvy, that many by this remedy only have recovered their Health, or preſerved it intire: For in thoſe leading an idle and ſedentary Life, the Blood and nervous Liquor like ſtanding Water contract a ſlimyneſs and muddy ſetlement: But by much and aſſiduous motion of the Body, the Humours and the Spirits grow clear and vigorous, the excrementitious and heterogeneous Particles evaporate, the ſtuffings of the <hi>Viſcera</hi> are diſcharged and their tone ſtrengthned.</p>

                     <p>A Gentlewoman, tall and handſome, about 25 years of age, had contracted the ſcorbutick Taint by reaſon of various errors in living, or manner of life, the ſigns of which were a ſpontaneous wearineſs, difficult breathing, pains and ſpots in her Legs, beſides her Gums ſwollen and bloody; in the ſpring time after miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage falling into a tertian Feavour, ſuddenly ſhe became languiſhing and weak, from which diſeaſe, however ſhe had been quickly recovered, being at firſt methodical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cured, but that greedy of fleſh and other incongruous things, ſhe ſoon fell into a Relapſe. But then growing weary of Medicine, ſhe took only empirical Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, by which ſometimes her Ague fits were driven away, then ſoon after they returned: In the mean time ſhe remained pale, weak as to motion, breathing ſhort and ſwollen, and blown up near the Ventricle and <hi>Hypochondria.</hi> About the third month of her ſickneſs ſhe began to feel cruel Pains and Torments in her Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; which afflicted her almoſt continually night and day, running about, now at her Back, now in her Stomach; Beſides ſhe was affected ſometimes with hyſterical Fits, and with a frequent Vertigo, alſo being troubled with often Vomiting, ſhe day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly caſt forth a clammy and frothy Flegme. Within a months ſpace this Diſeaſe diſplaying its ends, ſtirred up Pains in the Back, Loyns and then in every part of the Body. But at this time ſhe complained of a great ſtraitneſs of her Breaſt, and a great contraction of the <hi>Viſcera.</hi> In the mean time the habit of her Body became very lean, that the Bones being deſtitute of fleſh, the Skin could hardly ſtick on them. Her Urine was little and red, on whoſe Superficies was a little Skin coloured like the tail of a Peacock. A little time after this, ſhe felt a ſtupor or numneſs and a ſenſe of pricking, ſometimes in her Belly, and ſometimes in her Limbs, and then the Pains and Torments began to be remitted, but in their place a Palſie ſucceeded, which within the ſpace of a week ſo invaded the Members of her whole Body, that ſhe could neither bend her hand or foot or any other part, nor move one jot from the place.</p>
                     <p>As to the Aetiology or the reaſon of the aforeſaid caſe,<note place="margin">The Reaſon.</note> this is plain that theſe more grievous Symptoms did wholly ſpring from a ſcorbutick Root; for by reaſon of the Taint being fixed chiefly in the Blood, the ſpontaneous wearineſs, the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult breathing, and alſo the intermitting Fever wavering and often returning, and other previous and as it were more light Skirmiſhes of Symptoms were indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced: further, the lixivial Urine and of variety of Colours, plainly indicated or ſhewed, a Blood corrupted with a ſulphureous Saline dyſcraſie or evil complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: which kind of Piſs by that means well known, I have taken notice of in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others affected with the like Diſeaſe. But when the morbid Seed in this ſick Gentlewoman, being plentifully increaſed, and flowing thorow the Maſs of Blood, did ſpread into the confines of the Brain and nervous Stock, the more grievous diſtempers did then ariſe; to wit, the morbifick Matter, conſiſting of heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous and irritative Particles, being depoſited within the Brain, brought in the <hi>Vertigo</hi> and Swimming, or turning round, and the ſpaſmodick or cramplike Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; then a Portion of it falling upon the Nerves of the intercoſtal and moving Pair, and being by their paſſages caſt upon the meſenterick Foldings, ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up the ſcorbutick Colick; and when the ſame matter being hugely increaſed, had come to many other Nerves, the painful Diſtempers were propagated almoſt into every part of the Body; for that the acid Recrements like to vitriolick <hi>Stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> being depoſited every where from the nervous Liquor, did incounter with the lixivial Salts, every where alſo poured forth from the Blood: Then laſtly when all the Nerves being by degrees filled and ſtuffed with the morbifick Matter, were ſo much obſtructed that the irradiation of the Spirits and their commerce were hindred, the Palſie followed upon the whole Body.</p>
                     <p>This Gentlewoman living far from hence,<note place="margin">The Cure,</note> had taken Medicines by the advice of a neighbour Phyſician, uſual againſt the diſtemper of the Colick; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which, when the Diſeaſe grew grievous, the Patient being brought to <hi>Oxford,</hi> made tryal of very many Remedies, both Antiſcorbutick and Antipara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytick almoſt of every kind and form, but without any benefit. Therefore after that every ordinary method of Curing, ſeemed not ſufficient for this Diſeaſe, it was thought good to proceed to great Remedies, and indeed not altogether free from danger: wherefore we adminiſterd to her, as ſick, weak and lean as ſhe was, a mercurial Medicine for ſalivation. The effect of which ſucceeded to wiſh, for the Flux at the mouth being riſen within two
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:40331:232"/> days, and perſiſting gently for many days without any evil Symptom, brought great eaſe to this Gentlewoman. For the Pains being mitigated, ſhe began to move a little her Members, and to deſire and to digeſt better her Food, and alſo to enjoy quiet Sleep. The Salivation being finiſhed, ſhe took a Decoction of Sarſa and China with Antiparalytick ingredients for a few days; then being carried to the Bath, ſhe there uſed for ſome time the more gentle and temperate Baths, and preſently recovered an indifferent ſtate of Health. All the Winter, ſhe conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly took Medicines againſt the Scurvy and the Palſy, and when the following year, ſhe repeated the uſe of the Baths, ſhe grew perfectly well, and afterwards became the joyful Mother of ſeveral Children.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Obſervation.</note>A Man about 40, of a Melancholy temper, labouring for many years with the Scurvy, was wont to be ſenſible of divers and manifold Symptoms of it, at ſeveral times of the year. There appeared about his Thighs Spots and black large marks as if coming of ſtrokes; pains of the Belly, with a Looſeneſs often troubled him; his Urine for the moſt part appeared like Lye, and he almoſt conſtantly had a ſpontaneous wearineſs, a failure of his ſtrength, and a want of Appetite: Beſides theſe ordinary evils, and as it were cuſtomary, he lived obnoxious to moſt cruel Fits of Sickneſs, and thoſe of various kinds. Two years before when I firſt ſaw him, he complained moſt grievouſly of a difficulty in Breathing, as if he were in danger to be choaked, with a trembling of the Heart, with a fainting of the Spirits, and of a conſtant fear of Swooning: Beſides if any of theſe diſtempers in the <hi>Praecordia</hi> ceaſed a little, for the moſt part an heavy giddineſs in the head, and <hi>Vertigo</hi> aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him. After that he had taken for ſome time Antiſpaſmodick and Antiſcorbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Remedies mixed together, he ſeemed to be perfectly well; but then within a few weeks he was affected with a nauſeouſneſs and pain about the Heart, with an inflation of the <hi>Hypochondria;</hi> his Urine was little and very lixivial, and ſhortly after the <hi>Abdomen</hi> ſwelled up, and then his Feet and Legs with a great wateriſh ſwelling, ſhewed the ſigns of a growing Dropſy: afterwards the ſame Tumour invaded the fleſh of his Thighs, Arms, and Back alſo: which Diſtemper however though it ſeemed deſperate, was eaſily cured with antiſcorbutick Remedies, with the addition of Catharticks and Diureticks. But yet this remarkable perſon, although he was reſtored to health, did not continue ſo long: for two quarters of the year were ſcarcely paſt but he began to complain of a grievous Head-ach, with a <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigo</hi> and a pertinacious waking, and then without any evident cauſe, he was taken with moſt horrid Vomiting: a little while after, his aſthmatical fits, with the trembling of his Heart and ſinking down of his Spirits, returned. Alſo at this time, when he almoſt ſeemed deſperate, he again grew well in a little while, with the uſe of antiſcorbutick Medicines. It plainly appears by this caſe, how many evils the ſcorbutick infection, like to Ferment lying hid both in the Blood and nervous Juice, and as occaſion ſerves, ſpreading abroad its Poyſon, can cauſe; which kind of diſtempers, how horrid and terrible ſoever they ſeem, whilſt they depend only of the Humors vitiated in their Complexion, and that the <hi>Viſcera</hi> are not at all hurt in their Tone or Conformation, are wont to be cured moſt commonly very eaſily, or without much trouble, <hi>viz.</hi> with an antiſcorbutick Method aptly deſigned, both according to the condition of the Patient, and of the Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>A Lady about 25 years of Age, of a ſanguine Complexion, of a ſlender make of Body,<note place="margin">Obſervation.</note> of a fair skin and beautiful, had laboured for ſome time with the ſcorbutick diſtemper; for beſides broad ſpots and red ſwellings breaking forth in divers parts of her body, ſhe was wont to be troubled of a long time with cruel pains and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, chiefly vexing her at nights, ſometimes in her Legs and ſometimes in her Arms: She had often begun to take Phyſick for the Cure, but being with Child was forced to give it over. After her laſt Child, for that ſhe had great fluxes, ſhe remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for many days languiſhing and weak, with difficulty of breathing, and upon any motion breathleſs. Being riſen up after lying in her month, and endeavouring to walk ſhe fell into a moſt grievous <hi>dyſpnoea</hi> or ſhortneſs of breath, with the trembling of the heart and a frequent fainting or ſinking of the Spirits: Being preſently put to Bed, yet trembling and with quick palpitations, ſhe continued ſo for almoſt a whole day; beſides her lower Members as if they had been dead, were altogether ſtiff and cold, and could not be made warm with the applications of warm cloaths or by rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing: At length the night being almoſt paſt, ſhe found her ſelf better about her <hi>Praecordia,</hi> ſtrong Cordials having been often adminiſtred to her, but there ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:40331:232"/> a very acute pain on the top of her Thigh nigh to her left Groin, reaching even down to the Calf of her Leg, and within a few hours a hard tumor reſiſting the touch, poſſeſſed all that ſpace. Being ſent for at this time whilſt the ſick was gaping for breath, a Clyſter being preſcribed and taken, I gave her 12 drops of the Spirit of Hartshorn, in a ſpoonful of the following Julap, ℥ij of the ſame being drunk after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Take of the water of Snails ℥vj, of hyſterical water ℥iiij, of Walnuts ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and of Pennyroyal each ℥iij, of Sugar ℥j, of <hi>Caſtor</hi> tyed in a Rag and hung in the Glaſs <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>j. Theſe Medicines were repeated every ſixth hour. I took care to have a large Veſicatory to be applyed to the inward part of her Thigh, then in the evening for that ſhe had continued all this fit without any ſleep, I gave her j grain of <hi>Laudanum,</hi> of the pouder of Pearls vj <hi>gr.</hi> of the Confection of <hi>Alchermes</hi> without Musk <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ſs: She ſlept quietly, and in the morning was very much refreſhed, the pain and tumour of her Thigh were ſomewhat abated, alſo while ſhe lay quiet in her bed ſhe was well at her <hi>Praecordia,</hi> but if ſhe ſat up or turned of one ſide, ſhe preſently ſeemed as if ſhe would expire with the <hi>dyſpnoea</hi> or want of breath. She continued to repeat the uſe of the Hartſhorn and Julap every ſixth hour for ſome days; but becauſe ſhe was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with a troubleſome thirſt, and that her Urine was little and the Contents red and high coloured, ſhe took a doſe to <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>vj twice a day of the following <hi>Apozem.</hi> Take of Graſs Roots, Chervil, <hi>Eringo</hi>'s preſerv'd, each <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>vj, of the ſhavings of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vory and of Hartshorn each <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ij, of Hartshorn burnt <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>jſs, of Raiſins of the Sun ℥ij, 1 cut Apple, of Liquoriſh <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ijſs, being cut and bruiſed let them be boyled in 3 pints of Spring water, to the conſumption of the third part; then add of White wine ℥iiij, let it be ſtrained into a Jugg, to which put of the leaves of Scuryygraſs and of Brook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime each <hi>m.</hi> j, of the Salt of Wormwood <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ij, make an Infuſion cloſe ſhut and warm for 3 hours, being ſtrained let it be kept in cloſe Veſſels: Sometimes every day, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times every other day they gave her Clyſters. By the daily uſe of theſe ſhe ſeemed to be better, ſo that within the ſpace of a Week ſhe was able, being raiſed from her bed, to ſit up in a Chair by the fire ſide for 2 or 3 hours: But if ſhe ſat up a little too long, or did but endeavour to ſtir, ſhe preſently fell into an aſthmatical fit or <hi>dyſpnoea;</hi> ſo that one day having ſtayed ſomewhat longer out of her Bed, having ſuffered a moſt heavy aſſault of the Diſeaſe, ſhe was afflicted with a difficulty of Reſpiration, with a trembling of her whole Body, and continual ſinking of her Spirits: By reaſon of this Relapſe of the ſick Lady, at laſt I being ſent for, gave her 20 drops of the Spirit of Hartshorn with the above preſcribed Julap, and at night a doſe of our <hi>Laudanum;</hi> but when ſhe began to be better about her <hi>Praecordi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e Remedies hitherto cited, ſhe took twice a day of our Wine of the Juice of Scurvy graſs ℥iiij, with ℥ij of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſterial antiſcorbutick water. Beſides I ordered a Purge of our ſolutive Syrup a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove preſcribed, which ſucceeded ſo well, that I repeated it again within 3 or 4 days. With theſe Remedies ſhe grew well within a Month.</p>
                     <p>As to the Reaſons of the Symptoms obſerved in the aforeſaid caſe,<note place="margin">The Reaſon.</note> firſt it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious from the ſpots and pains of the Limbs, that the Blood and nervous Juice had been for a good while touched with the ſcorbutick taint, which notwithſtanding lay hid within the aforeſaid humours, as it were ſubjugated and without any ſignal evil, ſo long as they were ſtrong in the vital and Animal Spirits: But after the great hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhage or flux of Blood, when the Blood and nervous Liquor grew weak in their <hi>Craſis</hi> or Complexion, the particles of the morbid ſeed like to ferment, being moved, ſtirred up thoſe terrible diſtempers: That grievous <hi>Dyſpnoea</hi> or want of breath, ſeemed to ariſe from a double cauſe, or a concourſe of a double evil, to wit, becauſe certain pneumonick Nerves being beſet with the ſcorbutick matter, were hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred as to their office of Reſpiration: For from hence there was a neceſſity that the Lungs ſhould be ſwiftly moved, that they might draw the Blood from the heart, and the act of Reſpiration being more weak by reaſon of the Nerves being hindred, it became therefore more ſhort and very laborious: A fit of the <hi>Dyſpnoea</hi> urging, when as the Blood about the <hi>Praecordia</hi> was very much agitated, the extreme parts (which were then almoſt wholly wanting) by reaſon of its abſence grew ſtiff and cold; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards when as the Spaſms or Convulſions of the Lungs abated, and that the Blood being greatly imbued with the morbifick matter, which it had there ſupped up, looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from its ſtagnation, was returned to Circulation, that ruſhing impetuouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her Thighs, firſt into her left, then into her right, the other being deſerted and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:40331:233"/> ſo overflowing its Channels, being extravaſated with the ſerous filth, cauſed that ſudden tumor with the red ſwelling. But by reaſon of the ſhifting of the morbifick matter into the more ignoble parts to and again, the Diſeaſe though it ſeem'd very dangerous, eaſily gave way to Remedies, altering the dyſcraſies or evil diſpoſitions of the humors, and gently carrying away the Reliques of the morbifick Mine.</p>
                     <p>A Noble Gentleman about 33 years of Age, of a ſanguine Complexion as he ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be,<note place="margin">Obſervation.</note> tall and ſlender, of a very ſharp wit and great underſtanding, although he had exerciſed himſelf very much for a long time in immoderate and unſeaſonable ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, together with an inordinate way of living, yet to that time being freſh and full of vigor, he ſeemed to enjoy a whole mind in a ſound body; a little more than two years before, when he had very much tyred himſelf in dancing a whole night among his Gueſts, in the morning going into a cold Bed in a Chamber ſomewhat moiſt, deſirous of a little Sleep he began to be Sick; for being awaked he fell into great perturbations about the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> with great fainting of the Spirits: After having taken a draught of Wine and ſome Cardiack Remedies, he was ſomewhat bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but by and by he relapſed, ſo that both himſelf and his friends feared all that day a mortal ſwooning or an imminent Apoplexy. But after this Aſſault of the Diſeaſe had paſſed over, he lived after that ſtill obnoxious to daily paſſions of the Heart, and upon any more great error in living, he was wont again to be troubled with moſt grievous fits. Notwithſtanding the uſe of Remedies, the Diſeaſe increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon him within a few Months, it not only infeſted the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> but in the whole habit of his Body, Suffuſions ſometimes of cold, ſometimes of heat, and beſides a <hi>ſtupor</hi> or numneſs, or ſenſe of tingling or pricking, or light and ſudden Convulſions or Contractions in his Limbs were excited: And of late beſides theſe Symptoms ſpoken of already; which although they were very grievous to this Noble Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, yet he was further troubled after a terrible manner with a frequent <hi>Vertigo,</hi> and with diſtractions and decay of the Spirits, that inhabit the forepart of the Brain, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that he was forced to abſtain from Studies and Political Affairs (to which he was always addicted) yea and from every more ſerious intention of the Mind; for otherways he felt thoſe ſort of perturbations both in the Head and in the Nervous Stock, that made him fear an Aſſault of the aſtoniſhing Diſeaſe, or moſt horrid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive Affections: Whilſt he had the more grievous Fits of this Diſeaſe, his Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle alſo was diſturbed for the moſt part, but he often received eaſe by Vomit, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the free aſſiſtance of Nature, or by the help of an emetick Medicine. Hence ſome thought the cauſe of the Diſeaſe, to ſubſiſt altogether about the Stomach or the <hi>Hypochondria,</hi> but Catharticks, Emeticks, Digeſtive, Cephalick, Anti-ſcorbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, Chalybeate, and other Medicines almoſt of every kind, preſcribed him for two years by the moſt famous Phyſicians, and alſo by Empiricks and Quacks, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited little towards the Cure of the Diſeaſe. Of late having tryed <hi>Aſtrop</hi> waters, he found himſelf worſe for the uſe of them, preſently deſiſting, he was next advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be carried to the ſulphureous waters at <hi>Knaſborough</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> but with what ſucceſs I have not as yet learned.</p>
                     <p>This caſe becauſe by reaſon of the Concourſe of various Symptoms, it can belong to no other kind of Diſeaſe beſides, is not undeſervedly referred to the Scurvy; for it may be ſuſpected that the procatarctick or Remote Cauſe of this Sickneſs, lay in the evil diſpoſition of the Blood, to wit, that its Liquor was degenerated from a Balſamick and a ſpirituous, into a ſharp and ſulphureous-ſaline, by reaſon of theſe Elements being carried up above meaſure, which indeed ſeems to have happened partly from Errors in living, for that this Noble Perſon being often kept by buſineſs or more ſerious Studies even till Midnight, was wont to ſup at that time, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to go to bed to ſleep: Further, this Diſeaſe did partly ariſe from a ſickly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Spleen, and perhaps of the other <hi>Viſcera,</hi> ſupplying the Blood with a morbid ferment, neither is it altogether without reaſon, that we judge the Spleen ſhould be accuſed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The Reaſon.</note>The Blood labouring with the aforeſaid Dyſcraſie, and from thence gathering together heterogeneous Recrements, eaſily poured the ſame on the head, being helped by the evident cauſe: Wherefore when the Brain by reaſon of immoderate and untimely ſtudies, being ſomething debilitated became leſs ſtrong to reſiſt the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, and when for that occaſion before cited, the bloody Maſs being carried up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a greater ebullition, the pores of the whole Body being by and by ſhut up, it could not be ſo well eventilated, its great ſuffuſion or ſpreading into the head
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:40331:233"/> brought on the firſt manifeſt ſickneſs, to wit, from the Blood too much heaped up about the Region of the Head, firſt the ſwelling up and <hi>Phlogoſis</hi> or inflammation of the Face came: Further, from the ſame at that time impetuouſly ruſhing on the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Brain, and there ſtagnating the heterogene Particles, partly Narcotick, partly exploſive, fell down into the Origin of the Nerves, which being ſo beſet with incongruous matter, thoſe perturbations ſtirred up about the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> (for the Reaſons ſhown in the ſpaſmodick Pathology) did ſucceed. Further, for as much as the ſame matter being dilated towards the hinder part of the head, coming upon the Nerves, ariſing from the ſpinal marrow, it invaded the extreme paſſages and proceſſes of them all, and ſtirred up through the whole Body, a <hi>ſtupor,</hi> pricking, and the lighter Cramps or Convulſions. Moreover, becauſe the Nerves and their branches compaſſing about the ſanguiferous Veſſels, being affected with Convulſions were variouſly contracted, thoſe ſudden diffuſions or ſpreadings of heat and cold, by reaſon of the Bloods being as it were ſometimes reſtrained with a Bridle, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times agitated forward with a Spur, did ariſe through the whole Body.</p>
                     <p>About the beginning of the Diſeaſe, becauſe the morbifick matter being ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Maſs of Blood, breaking forth firſt either on the Region of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, or if admitted into the Brain, being from thence preſently ſent forth, it fixed chiefly about the original of the Nerves, therefore the chief taint appeared in the nervous Appendix, and about its exterior proceſſes without any <hi>Vertigo</hi> or previous ſwimming or Scotomy, or any notable hurt in the chief powers of the Soul: But afterwards by reaſon of the dyſcraſie of the Blood being daily increaſed, and the conſtitution of the Brain or <hi>Encephalon</hi> being more weakned, the heterogeneous Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles alſo breaking through into the anterior Brain, or the regal Palace of the Soul, they brought on both the diſtractions and meltings or ſinking down of the Spirits inhabiting there: So that this Diſeaſe after that its Roots being once planted ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where within the <hi>Encephalon,</hi> did daily ſhew its intentions, notwithſtanding the uſe of Medicines, as that at firſt only the original of the nervous wandring pair, and the intercoſtal were infected, and then afterwards the morbiſick matter entred into the proceſſes and interior paſſages of the other Nerves of the whole Body, which being filled full, at length that being carried by the as yet impure Blood into the Brain it ſelf, it poſſeſſed its more noble Cells, which kind of Cephalick Diſtempers, I have obſerved to have made the like progreſs in many, ſo that it plainly appears theſe Symptoms excited by ſuch a <hi>Series,</hi> ariſe by reaſon of the aforeſaid Cauſes, and not from Vapours ſuppoſed to be elevated from the <hi>Viſcera</hi> or inwards.</p>
                     <p>But that a fit urging oftentimes the Ventricle was diſturbed, alſo that it was wont to be ſuddenly eaſed by Vomit, it will not be difficult to ſhew the reaſons without prejudice to this <hi>Hypotheſis.</hi> As to the firſt, there is nothing more plain than that the Ventricle is ſubverted, and that a nauſeouſneſs or Vomiting doth ſucceed, by reaſon of ſome grief inflicted on the Origin of the Nerves, as we have at large al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready declared, then there is more reaſon for that Vomiting ſhould bring preſent help: For in the firſt place, as the Nerves of the wandring pair and the Intercoſtal are very much ſhaken, (as it is the manner of the Nervous Parts) they preſently remit their inordinations excited from an internal cauſe, as an itching or pained member is freed from grief if it be ſcratched or rubbed. But the aforeſaid Nerves being greatly ſhaken together and contracted in Vomiting, they eaſily ſhake off the morbifick Matter, fixed to their ends or extremities; by which it comes to paſs, that oftentimes a ſharp or acid Matter, or otherwiſe infeſtous, being heaped up within the firſt Paſſages, and there either infecting the Blood, with its hurtful Ferment, or irritating the nervous Bodies into Convulſions, is brought away by Vomit, and ſo the Fountain or Provocative of the Diſeaſe is carried forth.</p>
                     <p>As to the therapeutick or curatory Method, to be uſed in this caſe, and others like it, there are two intentions which are chiefly to be inſiſted on, <hi>viz.</hi> In the firſt place to make pure the Maſs of Blood, and to bring away the noxious Ferment adminiſtred from the Ventricle, Spleen, and other <hi>Viſcera.</hi> Secondly, that the Brain and nervous Stock be ſtrengthned, leſt they admit of extraneous Particles: and that the nervous Juice watering thoſe parts, degenerating from a right into acetous or otherwiſe morbid <hi>Craſis,</hi> may be rectified and reſtored. The firſt of theſe are to be performed by Catharticks, Emeticks, Phlebotomy, and cheifly by ſpecifick Medicins, correcting the ſcorbutick Taint of the Blood, or carrying it quite away: But as to this Iron or Vitriolick Spring, celebrated for the purging the
